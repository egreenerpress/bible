<h3 class="index-book-title">Galatians Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029104"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">O foolish Galatians! Who has deceived you and led you astray from obeying the truth? Was it not clear to you how Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified before your very eyes?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I simply want to ask you this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works required by the law, or by believing what you heard through faith?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are you so unwise? You began your journey by the power of the Spirit; are you now trying to complete it by relying on human effort?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029107"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Have you endured so much for nothing? If indeed it was not for nothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So then, the one who supplies you with the Spirit and works miracles among you—does he do this by your observance of the law, or by your belief in the message you heard?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as Abraham believed God, and his faith was credited to him as righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Understand this, then: those who live by faith are the true descendants of Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Scripture, foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous through faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham, saying, "Through you, all the nations will be blessed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, those who live by faith are blessed together with Abraham, who was faithful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is clear that no one is made right with God by following the law, as Scripture declares: "The righteous will live by faith."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The law is not based on faith; rather, it is as it is written: "The one who does these things will live by them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Christ has freed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse in our place, as it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that the blessing given to Abraham might extend to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, and that we might receive the promised Spirit by faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Brothers and sisters, I am speaking in human terms: Even when it is only a human covenant, once it is established, no one can cancel it or add to it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The promises were given to Abraham and his descendant. It does not say, "and to descendants," referring to many, but rather, "and to your descendant," referring to one—who is Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And this is what I mean: the covenant that God previously established and confirmed in Christ cannot be nullified by the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to invalidate the promise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if the inheritance comes through the law, it no longer depends on the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why, then, was the law given? It was established because of transgressions, serving as a temporary measure until the arrival of the promised descendant to whom the promise was made. The law was enacted through the agency of angels and entrusted to a mediator.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A mediator does not represent just one party alone, but God is one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Does the law, then, oppose the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could bring life, then righteousness would indeed have come through the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Scripture has declared that all are under the power of sin, so that the promise grounded in faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Before the arrival of faith, we were held in custody under the law, confined until the coming faith was to be revealed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029127"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, the law served as our guardian to lead us to Christ, so that we might be made right with God through faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029128"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of a guardian.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029129"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For you are all children of God through your faith in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All of you who have been baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029131"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Christ Jesus, there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile, slave and free, male and female, for you are all united as one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise.</span></p>
