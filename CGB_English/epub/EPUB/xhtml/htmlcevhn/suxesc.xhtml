<h3 class="index-book-title">I Samuel Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007371"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007372"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abiah. They served as judges in Beersheba.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007373"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His sons did not follow his example; instead, they pursued dishonest gain, accepted bribes, and corrupted justice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007374"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then all the elders of Israel assembled together and went to Samuel at Ramah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007375"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to him, "You are now old, and your sons do not follow your ways. Appoint a king to lead us, so we can be governed like all the other nations."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007376"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, Samuel was deeply troubled when they said, "Appoint a king to lead and govern us." So Samuel prayed to the LORD about the matter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007377"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to the people’s voice in everything they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, refusing to let me reign over them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007378"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Based on all the actions they have carried out from the day I brought them out of Egypt up to this very day—how they have abandoned me and worshiped other gods—they are now doing the same to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007379"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now then, listen to their demand; however, you must solemnly warn them and clearly explain to them the ways of the king who will rule over them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007380"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Samuel conveyed all the words of the LORD to the people who had requested a king from him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007381"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "This is how the king who will rule over you will act: He will take your sons and assign them to serve him—some to drive his chariots, others to serve as his cavalry, and still others to run ahead of his chariots."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007382"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will assign commanders over thousands and over fifties, and he will put them to work plowing his fields, harvesting his crops, and crafting his weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007383"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will take your daughters to work as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007384"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will seize your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves—even the finest among them—and hand them over to his servants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007385"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards, and give it to his officials and his servants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007386"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and he will use them for his own purposes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007387"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will become his subjects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007388"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that day, you will cry out because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007389"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the people refused to listen to Samuel’s warning and insisted, “No! We are determined to have a king rule over us.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007390"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that we too may be like all the other nations, with a king to govern us, lead us, and fight our battles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007391"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Samuel listened carefully to everything the people said and then repeated their words to the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007392"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to their request and appoint a king for them." Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "Each of you, return to your own city."</span></p>
