<h3 class="index-book-title">Psalms Chapter 53</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014721"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">(For the music director, to be played on the *Mahalath* instrument. A contemplative psalm of David.) The fool declares in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their actions are detestable; there is no one who does what is good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014722"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God gazed down from heaven upon humanity to observe whether there were any who truly understood, any who earnestly sought after Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014723"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All of them have turned away; they have become utterly corrupt. There is no one who does goodâ€”not even a single one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014724"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do those who practice wickedness lack understanding? They devour my people as if they were consuming bread, yet they do not call upon God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014725"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were overwhelmed with terror where there was no reason to fear, for God has scattered the bones of those who set themselves against you. You have brought them to disgrace, because God has rejected them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100014726"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If only the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will celebrate, and Israel will be filled with joy.</span></p>
