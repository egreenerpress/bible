<h3 class="index-book-title">Zechariah Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022964"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the fourth year of King Darius’s reign, on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is the month of Kislev, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022965"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they sent Sherezer and Regem-melech, along with their companions, to the house of God to seek the LORD’s favor and present their prayers before Him,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022966"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And to address the priests who served in the temple of the LORD of hosts, as well as the prophets, asking, "Should I continue to mourn and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022967"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the message of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022968"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying: When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months during those seventy years, were you truly fasting for me? Was it really for my sake?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022969"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you ate and when you drank, were you not eating and drinking for your own benefit?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022970"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Should you not pay attention to the messages that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets, back when Jerusalem was thriving and secure, along with the surrounding towns, and when people lived in the southern region and the lowlands?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022971"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The message of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022972"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is what the LORD of hosts declares: Carry out justice that is genuine, and show kindness and compassion to one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022973"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not mistreat the widow, the orphan, the foreigner, or the poor. Furthermore, do not harbor any malicious thoughts in your heart against your fellow human being.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022974"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, they refused to listen, turned their backs in defiance, and covered their ears so they would not hear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022975"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, they hardened their hearts like flint, refusing to listen to the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent through his Spirit by the earlier prophets. As a result, the LORD of hosts poured out his great wrath upon them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022976"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, it has come to pass that just as they cried out and I did not listen, so now when they cry out, I will not listen, declares the LORD of hosts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022977"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I dispersed them like a whirlwind among all the nations they had not known. As a result, the land became desolate after their departure, so that no one traveled through it or returned to it. For they had turned the delightful land into a wasteland.</span></p>
