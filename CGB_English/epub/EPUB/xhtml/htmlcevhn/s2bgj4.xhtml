<h3 class="index-book-title">Mark Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024465"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024466"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they noticed that some of his disciples were eating bread with unclean hands—that is, without washing them—they criticized them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024467"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands frequently, following the tradition passed down by their ancestors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024468"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they return from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they first wash themselves. There are also many other traditions they observe, which they have received and hold to, such as the ritual washing of cups, pots, bronze vessels, and dining tables.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024469"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not follow the traditions handed down by our ancestors, but instead eat bread with hands that are not ceremonially washed?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024470"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied and said to them, "Isaiah prophesied accurately about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024471"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of human beings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024472"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You set aside the commandment of God in order to hold tightly to human traditions, such as the ritual washing of pots and cups. And you do many other things like this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024473"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "You are very good at setting aside God's commandment in order to uphold your own tradition."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024474"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moses said, "Honor your father and your mother," and, "Whoever curses their father or mother must be put to death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024475"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But you say, "If someone declares to his father or mother, 'This is Corban' (which means a dedicated gift to God), then whatever you might have gained from me is no longer available to you." In this way, you allow him to be free from any obligation to support his parents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024476"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024477"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You nullify the word of God by upholding your own traditions, which you have passed down. And you do many other things like this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024478"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus had gathered all the people around him, he said to them, "Listen carefully, every one of you, and try to understand what I am saying."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024479"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person—from within—that defiles them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024480"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone has the ability to understand, let them listen carefully.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024481"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus had gone into the house, away from the crowd, his disciples asked him to explain the meaning of the parable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024482"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Are you also so lacking in understanding? Do you not realize that whatever enters a person from the outside cannot defile them?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024483"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because it does not enter into the heart, but into the stomach, and then passes out into the sewer, thereby cleansing all foods?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024484"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024485"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is from within, from the depths of a person's heart, that evil thoughts arise—acts of adultery, sexual immorality, and murder.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024486"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stealing, greed, malice, dishonesty, indecency, envy, slander, arrogance, and senselessness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024487"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All these harmful actions originate from within a person and are what truly corrupt them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024488"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and wanted to remain unnoticed, but it was impossible for him to stay hidden.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024489"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A certain woman, whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard about him. She came and fell at his feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024490"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician descent, and she pleaded with him to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024491"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024492"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She replied to him, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the crumbs that fall from the children's food."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024493"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to her, "Because of this response, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024494"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she arrived at her house, she found that the demon had left, and her daughter was lying on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024495"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, Jesus left the region of Tyre and Sidon and traveled to the Sea of Galilee, passing through the central area of the Decapolis region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024496"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024497"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus took the man away from the crowd to a private place. He put His fingers into the man’s ears, then spat and touched the man’s tongue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024498"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him, "Ephphatha," which means, "Be opened."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024499"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately his ears were opened, the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began to speak clearly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024500"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he strictly instructed them not to tell anyone about it. But the more he insisted, the more widely they spread the news.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024501"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were utterly amazed and said, "He has done everything perfectly! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</span></p>
