<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he intended to have him executed, he was afraid of the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Herod celebrated his birthday, the daughter of Herodias performed a dance in front of the guests, and her performance delighted Herod.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023605"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, he swore an oath to give her whatever she might request.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023606"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And she, having been previously instructed by her mother, said, "Give me here the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023607"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The king was deeply troubled, but because of his oath and out of respect for those who were dining with him, he ordered that her request be granted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023608"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023609"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His head was brought on a platter and given to the young woman, who then took it to her mother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023610"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his disciples came, took the body, buried it, and went to inform Jesus of what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023611"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus heard about it, he left that place by boat to go to a secluded, deserted area. But when the people learned of his departure, they followed him on foot from the towns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023612"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus went out and saw a large crowd. He was deeply moved with compassion for them, and he healed those among them who were sick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023613"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As evening approached, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby villages and buy food for themselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023614"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to leave; you give them something to eat."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023615"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023616"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Bring them here to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023617"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up toward heaven, and gave thanks. After breaking the loaves, he handed them to his disciples, who then distributed the bread to the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023618"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover pieces, filling twelve baskets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023619"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The number of those who ate was approximately five thousand men, not including the women and children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023620"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, Jesus urged his disciples to board a boat and go ahead of him to the other side of the lake, while he dismissed the crowds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023621"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After dismissing the crowds, Jesus went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was still there alone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023622"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ship was now far out at sea, being battered by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023623"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And during the final watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the water.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023624"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water, they were terrified and exclaimed, “It’s a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023625"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage; it is I. Do not be afraid."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023626"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter responded to Him, saying, "Lord, if it is truly You, command me to come to You on the water."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023627"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said, "Come." Then Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on the water, making his way toward Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023628"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when he noticed how strong the wind was, he became frightened, and as he began to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023629"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At once, Jesus reached out his hand, took hold of him, and said, "You who have such small faith, why did you let doubt take over?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023630"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023631"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then those who were in the boat approached him and bowed down in reverence, declaring, "Truly, you are the Son of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023632"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had crossed over, they arrived in the region of Gennesaret.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023633"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the people of that place recognized him, they sent word throughout the surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023634"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They earnestly pleaded with him, asking simply to touch the edge of his clothing.
