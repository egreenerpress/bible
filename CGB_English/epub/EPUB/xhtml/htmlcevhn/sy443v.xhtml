David, the son of Jesse, spoke—the man who was exalted to greatness, the one anointed by the God of Jacob, and the beloved psalmist of Israel. He declared:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008656"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, and His words were on my tongue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008657"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The God of Israel declared, the Rock of Israel spoke to me: "Whoever rules over people must be just, governing with reverence for God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008658"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will be like the brightness of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds; like the fresh grass that springs up from the earth after rain, gleaming in the sunlight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008659"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even though my household may not be perfect in God's sight, He has established with me an everlasting covenant, perfectly arranged and secure in every detail. This covenant is the foundation of my salvation and the fulfillment of all my longing, even if its full realization is not yet evident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008660"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the wicked will all be like thorns to be cast aside, for they cannot be grasped by hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008661"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The person who dares to touch them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they will be completely consumed by fire in that very place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008662"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: The first was Adino the Eznite, chief of the captains, also known as the Tachmonite. He once raised his spear and struck down eight hundred men in a single encounter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008663"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After him came Eleazar, the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors who fought alongside David. This was when they confronted the Philistines who had gathered for battle, even though the rest of the Israelite army had retreated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008664"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He stood up and struck down the Philistines until his hand grew tired and his hand clung to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day, and the people followed him only to plunder the spoils.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008665"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After him came Shammah, the son of Agee, from Harar. The Philistines had gathered in a raiding party, and there was a field full of lentils. The people fled from the Philistines.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008666"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So the Lord brought about a great victory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008667"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Three of the thirty leading warriors went down and came to David during the harvest season at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines had encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008668"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, David was staying in a stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was stationed in Bethlehem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008669"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David was deeply thirsty and said, "Oh, if only someone would bring me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, the one by the gate!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008670"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine forces, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it to David. However, he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008671"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, to do such a thing! Is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives to bring it?" Therefore, he refused to drink it. These were the deeds of these three mighty warriors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008672"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was the leader of the Three.

Therefore, he became their leader; yet he did not reach the status of the first three.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008674"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was a courageous man from Kabzeel who had accomplished many great deeds. He killed two mighty warriors of Moab who were as fierce as lions. Additionally, he went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008675"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he killed an Egyptian, a man of impressive stature. The Egyptian was armed with a spear, but he went down to him with only a staff, wrested the spear from the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own weapon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008676"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, accomplished these deeds and gained a reputation as one of the three mighty warriors.</span></p>
