<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025733"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus went into Jericho and was passing through it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025734"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was a chief tax collector and a wealthy man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025735"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he could not because of the crowd, as he was short in stature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025736"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He hurried ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to get a better view of him, because Jesus was about to pass by that way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025737"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and saw him, and said, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025738"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He quickly went down and welcomed him with great joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025739"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they saw this, they all began to complain, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025740"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I will give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have cheated anyone by false accusation, I will repay them four times as much.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025741"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a descendant of Abraham."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025742"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Son of Man has come to search for and to rescue those who are lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025743"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they listened to these things, Jesus continued by telling them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and because they assumed that the kingdom of God was about to appear right away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025744"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, he said, "A certain man of high rank went to a distant country to secure a kingdom for himself and then return."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025745"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He summoned ten of his servants and gave them ten minas, saying to them, "Conduct business with this until I return."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025746"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, his own citizens despised him and sent a delegation after him, declaring, "We refuse to let this man rule over us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025747"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he returned after receiving his kingdom, he summoned the servants to whom he had entrusted the money, so that he might find out how much each one had gained through their trading.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025748"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the first servant came forward and said, "Master, your investment has earned ten times its value."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025749"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a small matter, you will now have authority over ten cities."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025750"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The second servant came and said, "Master, your investment has earned five times its original amount."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025751"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he also said to him, "You too shall have authority over five cities."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025752"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then another servant came forward and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have kept safe, wrapped in a cloth.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025753"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025754"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a demanding man, collecting what I did not deposit and harvesting what I did not plant."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025755"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025756"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to those standing nearby, "Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025757"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to him, "Master, he already has ten pounds."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025758"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I tell you this: to everyone who already has, more will be given; but from the one who has little, even what they have will be taken away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025759"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But as for those enemies of mine who did not want me to rule over them, bring them here and execute them in my presence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025760"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying these things, he went ahead of them, making his way up to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025761"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the hill known as the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples ahead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025762"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Go to the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied there, one that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025763"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone asks you, "Why are you untying it?" you should answer, "Because the Lord needs it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025764"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The messengers went on their way and found everything just as he had told them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025765"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were untying the young donkey, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the donkey?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025766"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied, "The Lord has need of it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025767"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They brought the colt to Jesus, and after laying their cloaks on it, they helped Jesus mount it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025768"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he proceeded, they laid their garments on the road before him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025769"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he drew near, just at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the entire crowd of disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the powerful works they had witnessed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025770"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They proclaimed, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! May there be peace in heaven and glory in the highest places!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025771"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell Your disciples to stop this."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied to them, saying, "I tell you, if these people were to remain silent, the stones themselves would immediately cry out."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he approached and saw the city, he looked upon it and wept deeply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "If only you, even you, had recognized on this day the things that lead to peace! But now they are hidden from your sight."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025775"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A time will come upon you when your enemies will build siege works around you, surrounding you and hemming you in on every side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025776"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will bring you down to the ground, leveling you completely, and your children within you. Not one stone will be left upon another, because you did not recognize the time when God came to visit you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025777"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling goods there, as well as those who were buying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025778"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "It is written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of robbers."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025779"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He taught daily in the temple.
