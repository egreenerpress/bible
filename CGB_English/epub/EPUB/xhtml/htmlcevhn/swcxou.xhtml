<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025197"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had finished speaking all these words to the people, he went into Capernaum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025198"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A centurion had a servant whom he valued highly, and this servant was seriously ill, nearing the point of death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025199"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, pleading that he would come and heal his servant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025200"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they came to Jesus, they urgently pleaded with him, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025201"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he loves our people, and he has built us a synagogue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025202"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus went with them. When they were close to the house, the centurion sent friends to Jesus with a message, saying, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025203"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But simply speak the word, and my servant will be healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025204"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I, too, am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under my command. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025205"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at the man and turned to the crowd following him. He said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith, not even among the people of Israel."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025206"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant completely healed, the one who had been ill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025207"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, he went to a town called Nain, accompanied by many of his disciples and a large crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025208"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he approached the city gate, he saw a dead man being carried out. He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was with her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025209"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion and said to her, "Do not weep."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025210"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He approached and touched the funeral bier, and those carrying it came to a halt. Then he said, "Young man, I tell you, rise up."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025211"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025212"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then a sense of awe came over everyone, and they praised God, saying, "A great prophet has appeared among us!" and, "God has come to help his people!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025213"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and the surrounding region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025214"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disciples of John reported to him all these events.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025215"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus with this message: "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025216"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the men arrived and approached him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you with this question: Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025217"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that very moment, he healed many people of their illnesses and afflictions, and freed others from the power of evil spirits. He also restored sight to many who were blind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025218"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus responded to them, saying, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025219"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And blessed is anyone who does not take offense at me or stumble because of me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025220"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After John’s messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025221"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine, luxurious clothing? Look, those who wear splendid garments and live in luxury are found in royal palaces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025222"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025223"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the one about whom it is written: "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare the way before you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025224"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you this: Among all those born of women, there is no greater prophet than John the Baptist. Yet even the least significant person in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025225"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the people who heard him, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's justice by receiving John's baptism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025226"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025227"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Lord said, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025228"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling out to one another and saying, “We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we sang a lament, but you did not weep.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025229"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, "He is possessed by a demon."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025230"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at this man! He is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025231"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But wisdom is proven right by all who follow her ways.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025232"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him, so he entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table to share the meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025233"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And then, a woman from the city, who was known to be a sinner, learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house. She came carrying an alabaster jar of fragrant ointment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025234"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with her hair, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the fragrant oil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025235"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he thought to himself, "If this man were truly a prophet, He would know what kind of woman is touching Him—that she is a sinner."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025236"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded, saying to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” Simon replied, “Teacher, please speak.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025237"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a certain lender who had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025238"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they were unable to repay their debts, he generously canceled what both of them owed. Now tell me, which of them will love him more?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025239"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon replied, "I suppose it would be the one who was forgiven the most." Jesus said to him, "You have judged correctly."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025240"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not provide water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025241"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the moment I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025242"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025243"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—because she has shown great love. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025244"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025245"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And those who were dining with him began to wonder among themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025246"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</span></p>
