<h3 class="index-book-title">Mark Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024875"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the Sabbath had ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchased fragrant spices so they could go and anoint Jesus' body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024876"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Very early on the first day of the week, just as the sun was rising, they went to the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024877"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024878"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they looked, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024879"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a long white robe sitting on the right side. They were filled with alarm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024880"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Do not be afraid. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024881"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But go and tell his disciples—and especially Peter—that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024882"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They hurried out of the tomb and fled, overwhelmed with trembling and astonishment. They said nothing to anyone, for they were filled with fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024883"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, after Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She went and informed those who had been with him, as they were grieving and weeping.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Afterward, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking and traveling into the countryside.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went and reported it to the rest, but the others did not believe them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Afterward, he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe, because they had not trusted those who had seen him after he had risen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024889"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name, they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will handle snakes, and if they drink anything poisonous, it will not harm them. They will place their hands on the sick, and they will be healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the Lord had finished speaking to them, he was taken up into heaven and seated at the right hand of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went out and proclaimed the message everywhere, with the Lord working alongside them and confirming the truth of their message through the accompanying signs. Amen.</span></p>
