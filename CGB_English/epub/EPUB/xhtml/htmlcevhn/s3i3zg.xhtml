<h3 class="index-book-title">I Corinthians Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028456"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not even tolerated among the Gentiles—specifically, that a man is living with his father’s wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028457"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are filled with pride, instead of grieving, so that the one who committed this act might be removed from your midst.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028458"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I, though physically absent, am present with you in spirit, and I have already passed judgment, as if I were there with you, on the one who has committed this act.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028459"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are assembled together, and my spirit is present with you, by the authority and power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028460"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To hand such a person over to Satan for the destruction of their sinful nature, so that their spirit may be preserved and saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028461"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your boasting is not commendable. Are you not aware that even a small amount of leaven permeates the entire batch of dough?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028462"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, remove the old leaven of sin, so that you may become a fresh, new batch, just as you are meant to be free from corruption. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed on our behalf.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028463"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old yeast of sin, nor with the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of purity and truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028464"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with those who engage in sexual immorality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028465"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I was not referring to associating with the sexually immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters—for then you would have to completely withdraw from the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028466"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, I have written to you instructing that you should not associate with anyone who claims to be a fellow believer but is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, verbally abusive, a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even share a meal with such a person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028467"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why should I be responsible for judging those outside the church? Isn’t it your role to judge those within the church?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028468"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But those who are outside the faith, God will judge. Therefore, remove the wicked person from among your community.</span></p>
