<h3 class="index-book-title">Job Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On another occasion, the heavenly beings came to stand before the LORD, and Satan also appeared among them to present himself before the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan replied to the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth and walking back and forth across it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth—a man of complete integrity, upright, who fears God and turns away from evil. Even now, he remains steadfast in his integrity, though you incited me against him to destroy him without any just cause."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Satan replied to the LORD, saying, "A person will give up everything they own to save their own life—even their very skin. They will sacrifice anything to preserve themselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012897"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now, stretch out your hand and strike his body and his health, and he will surely curse you to your face.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Satan, "He is now in your power, but you must spare his life."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012899"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful boils from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012900"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself with, and he sat down in the ashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012901"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold on to your integrity? Curse God and die."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012902"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he replied to her, "You are speaking like one of the foolish women speaks. Should we accept only good from God and not also accept adversity?" In all this, Job did not sin by what he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012903"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Job’s three friends heard about all the calamity that had befallen him, each of them came from his own home: Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamath. They had agreed together to go and sympathize with him, to mourn with him, and to offer him comfort.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012904"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they looked up from a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. Each one tore his robe and threw dust into the air, letting it fall on their heads as a sign of mourning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100012905"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was overwhelming.</span></p>
