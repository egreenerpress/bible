I awakened you under the apple tree; there your mother went into labor with you, there she who gave birth to you brought you forth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017647"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Place me like a seal upon your heart, like a seal upon your arm; for love is as powerful as death, and passion as unyielding as the grave. Its flames are flames of fire, a blazing intensity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017648"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No amount of water can extinguish love, nor can floods overwhelm it. Even if someone were to offer all the wealth of their household in exchange for love, it would be utterly scorned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017649"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We have a young sister, and her breasts have not yet developed. What shall we do for our sister when the time comes for her to be sought in marriage?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017650"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If she is like a strong wall, we will build upon her a fortress of silver; but if she is like a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017651"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am like a strong wall, and my breasts are like towers; thus, in his eyes, I became as one who has found favor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017652"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Solomon owned a vineyard in Baal-hamon; he entrusted it to caretakers, each of whom was required to bring in a thousand pieces of silver as payment for its produce.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017653"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">My vineyard, which belongs to me, is here before me.
