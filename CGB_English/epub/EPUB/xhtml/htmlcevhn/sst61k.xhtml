<h3 class="index-book-title">II Timothy Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029811"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose and will of God, in accordance with the promise of eternal life that is found in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029812"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To Timothy, my deeply cherished son: May grace, mercy, and peace be yours from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029813"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, that I constantly remember you in my prayers, both night and day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029814"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I deeply long to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029815"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I recall the genuine faith that is within you, which first resided in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, I am convinced that it is also present in you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029816"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I remind you to rekindle the spiritual gift of God that is within you, which was imparted to you through the laying on of my hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029817"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God has not given us a spirit of timidity or fear, but one of strength, love, and self-discipline.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029818"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner. Instead, join in enduring hardship for the sake of the gospel, relying on the power of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029819"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He has saved us and called us with a sacred calling, not based on our deeds, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ Jesus before time itself began.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029820"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This truth has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has destroyed the power of death and has brought to light the reality of life and immortality through the gospel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029821"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this purpose, I have been appointed as a herald, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029822"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, I also endure these hardships. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom I have placed my trust, and I am fully convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that final day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029823"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Hold firmly to the pattern of wholesome teaching that you have received from me, with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029824"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Guard the valuable truth entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit who lives within us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029825"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware that all those in the province of Asia have turned away from me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029826"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">May the Lord show kindness to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often encouraged me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029827"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, when he was in Rome, he made great effort to search for me and eventually found me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029828"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">May the Lord grant him to receive mercy from the Lord on that day. And you know very well how much he served me in Ephesus.</span></p>
