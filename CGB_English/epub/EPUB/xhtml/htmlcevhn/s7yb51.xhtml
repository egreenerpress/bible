<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man from Adullam named Hirah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shuah, and he took her as his wife and slept with her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Shelah. This took place while she was in Chezib at the time of his birth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah arranged for his firstborn son, Er, to marry a woman named Tamar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001127"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Er, Judah’s firstborn, acted wickedly in the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001128"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah said to Onan, "Go and fulfill your duty as a brother-in-law by marrying your brother’s widow. Fulfill your obligation to her and provide offspring for your brother."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001129"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Onan understood that the offspring would not be considered his own; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he intentionally wasted his seed on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The action he took was displeasing to the LORD, and as a result, the LORD also put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001131"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Stay as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He might die too, like his brothers did." So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After some time had passed, the daughter of Shuah, Judah’s wife, died. Judah was comforted in his grief, and he went up to Timnath to join his sheepshearers, accompanied by his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Tamar was informed, saying, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnath to shear his sheep."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So she removed her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself up. Then she sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Judah saw her, he assumed she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He turned aside to her along the road and said, "Please, allow me to come in to you" (for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law). She replied, "What will you give me in return for allowing you to come in to me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "I will send you a young goat from the flock." But she replied, "Will you give me something as a guarantee until you send it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked, “What pledge should I give you?” She replied, “Your seal, your cord, and the staff you are holding.” So he gave them to her, lay with her, and she became pregnant by him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then she got up, left, and removed her veil. She put on the clothing of a widow instead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah sent the young goat with his friend the Adullamite to retrieve his pledge from the woman, but the man could not find her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he inquired of the men of that place, saying, "Where is the prostitute who was sitting openly by the roadside?" But they replied, "There has been no prostitute in this place."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went back to Judah and said, "I couldn't find her. Moreover, the men of that place told me there was no prostitute there."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah said, "Let her keep it, so that we are not disgraced. I sent this young goat, but you could not find her."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">About three months later, Judah was informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has acted promiscuously, and now she is pregnant as a result of her immorality." Judah responded, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she was brought forward, she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying, "I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong." She also said, "Please examine and identify whose these are—the signet ring, the bracelets, and the staff."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah acknowledged his actions and said, "She is more in the right than I am, because I did not give her to my son Shelah as I had promised." And he did not have intimate relations with her again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">During the time of her labor, it happened that there were twins in her womb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001148"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As she was giving birth, one of the babies reached out his hand. The midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his hand, saying, "This one came out first."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001149"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he pulled back his hand, suddenly his brother came out, and she exclaimed, “How have you broken through? This breach is your responsibility!” So he was named Perez.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001150"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Afterward, his brother came out, the one with the scarlet thread tied around his hand, and he was named Zerah.</span></p>
