There, the LORD showed him the entire land of Gilead, extending as far as Dan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005842"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the territory of Naphtali, along with the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the entire land of Judah, extending as far as the western sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005843"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the southern region, along with the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city known for its palm trees, extending as far as Zoar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005844"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, declaring, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over into it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005845"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had declared.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005846"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, near Beth-peor, but to this day, no one knows the location of his grave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005847"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyesight had not weakened, nor had his vitality diminished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005848"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Israelites mourned for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days. After this, the period of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005849"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. The Israelites listened to Joshua and obeyed him, doing as the LORD had commanded through Moses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005850"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since that time, no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew intimately, speaking with him directly, face to face.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005851"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In all the miraculous signs and extraordinary acts of power that the LORD commanded him to perform in the land of Egypt—against Pharaoh, all his officials, and the entire land—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005852"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And through all the acts of that mighty power, and through all the great and awe-inspiring deeds that Moses performed in the presence of all Israel.</span></p>
