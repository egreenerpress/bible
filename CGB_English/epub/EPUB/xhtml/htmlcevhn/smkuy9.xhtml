<h3 class="index-book-title">Genesis Chapter 44</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph instructed the manager of his household, saying, "Fill the men's bags with as much grain as they can carry, and place each man's money back into the top of his sack."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Place my cup, the silver one, in the top of the youngest brother’s sack, along with his grain money. And he did exactly as Joseph had instructed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as dawn broke, the men were sent on their way, along with their donkeys.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had left the city and were not yet far away, Joseph said to his steward, "Go quickly, pursue the men, and when you catch up to them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Isn’t this the cup that my master drinks from, and the one he uses for divination? What you have done is wrong."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He caught up with them and spoke to them these very words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to act in this manner!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Look, we have brought back to you the money that we found in the top of our sacks, all the way from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If any of your servants is found to have it, let that person be put to death, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said, "Let it be as you have said: the one with whom the item is found will become my servant, and the rest of you will be free from blame."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He began his search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest. The cup was discovered in Benjamin’s sack.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they tore their clothes in grief, loaded each man his donkey, and went back to the city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001339"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house, as he was still there, and they bowed down before him, their faces to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001340"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph said to them, "What is this thing you have done? Do you not realize that a man like me can surely discern the truth?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001341"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah replied, "What can we say to my lord? How can we explain ourselves? Or how can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered the guilt of your servants. Here we are, my lord—we are your servants, both we and the one in whose possession the cup was found."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001342"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph replied, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found with the cup will become my servant. As for the rest of you, go back to your father in peace."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001343"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Judah approached him and said, "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in your hearing, and do not let your anger rise against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001344"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">My lord inquired of his servants, saying, "Do you have a father or a brother?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001345"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We said to my lord, "We have an elderly father and a younger brother, born to him in his old age. The boy’s brother is dead, and he is the only one left of his mother’s children. Our father loves him deeply."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001346"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you said to your servants, "Bring him down to me, so that I may see him with my own eyes."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001347"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We said to my lord, "The young man cannot leave his father, for if he were to leave his father, his father would die."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001348"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you said to your servants, "Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001349"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When we returned to your servant, my father, we relayed to him the message of my lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001350"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Our father said, "Go back and purchase a little more food for us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001351"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We replied, "We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go down, for we are not allowed to see the man's face unless our youngest brother is present."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001352"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And my father, your servant, said to us, "You know that my wife bore me two sons:"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001353"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of them left me, and I thought, 'Surely he has been torn to pieces.' I have not seen him since.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001354"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if you take this one from me as well, and harm comes to him, you will send my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001355"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So now, when I return to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—since his life is deeply connected to the boy’s life—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001356"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is what will happen: when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will have brought down the gray hair of your servant, our father, in sorrow to the grave.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001357"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your servant pledged himself as a guarantee for the boy to my father, saying, "If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the guilt before my father forever."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001358"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I now ask you, please let your servant remain here as a slave to my lord in place of the young man, and allow the young man to return with his brothers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001359"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How can I return to my father if the boy is not with me? I cannot bear to see the suffering that would come upon my father.</span></p>
