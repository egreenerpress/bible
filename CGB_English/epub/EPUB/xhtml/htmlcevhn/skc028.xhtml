<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024197"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the Sabbath was ending and the first day of the week was just beginning to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024198"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, there was a powerful earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, approached the tomb, rolled away the stone from the entrance, and sat on it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024199"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His appearance was as brilliant as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024200"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And because of their fear of him, the guards trembled and fell to the ground as if they were dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024201"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The angel responded and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024202"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He is not here, for he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where the Lord was laid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024203"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Go quickly and inform his disciples that he has risen from the dead. Listen, he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024204"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They hurried away from the tomb, filled with both awe and overwhelming joy, and ran to tell his disciples the news.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024205"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were on their way to inform his disciples, suddenly Jesus appeared before them and greeted them, saying, "Greetings!" They approached him, took hold of his feet, and bowed down in reverence to worship him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024206"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024207"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were leaving, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024208"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they had gathered with the elders and consulted together, they offered a substantial sum of money to the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024209"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Tell people that his disciples came during the night and stole his body while we were asleep."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024210"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If this matter reaches the governorâ€™s attention, we will convince him and ensure your safety.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024211"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they took the money and did as they had been instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jewish people to this very day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024212"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the eleven disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had instructed them to go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024213"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they saw him, they bowed down in reverence, though some among them were uncertain and hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024214"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus approached them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024215"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024216"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Instruct them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, even to the very end of the age. Amen.</span></p>
