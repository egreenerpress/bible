Listen, I will heal you. On the third day, you will go up to the house of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100010105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will add fifteen years to your life.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100010106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaiah said, "Take a lump of figs." They took it and placed it on the boil, and he was healed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100010109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Hezekiah replied, "It is a simple matter for the shadow to move forward ten steps.

Not a single thing will remain, declares the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100010117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your own sons, who will be born to you, will be taken away from you, and they will be made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100010120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Hezekiah died and was buried with his ancestors, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.</span></p>
