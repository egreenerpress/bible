<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, during the fourth year of Solomonâ€™s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv (which is the second month), he began to construct the house of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008899"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008900"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The porch in front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the temple itself, and it extended ten cubits in depth from the front of the temple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008901"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the house, he made windows with narrow openings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008902"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He constructed rooms along the walls of the house, surrounding both the main sanctuary and the inner sanctuary. These chambers were built all around the structure, encircling the temple on every side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008903"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The lowest level of the structure was five cubits wide, the middle level was six cubits wide, and the top level was seven cubits wide. This was because the outer walls of the house were designed with recessed supports all around, so that the beams would not be anchored directly into the walls of the house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008904"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the house was being constructed, it was built with stone that had been prepared at the quarry before being brought to the site. As a result, no sound of hammers, axes, or any iron tools was heard in the house while it was being built.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008905"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The entrance to the middle chamber was on the right side of the building. They ascended to it by means of a winding staircase, leading from the middle chamber up to the third.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008906"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he constructed the house and completed it, then he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008907"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he constructed side chambers along the entire house, each five cubits high, and they were attached to the house with cedar timbers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008908"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD spoke to Solomon, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008909"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Regarding this temple that you are building, if you walk in obedience to my statutes, carry out my ordinances, and faithfully keep all my commandments by living according to them, then I will fulfill the promise I made to your father David concerning you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008910"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will live among the people of Israel and will never abandon my people, Israel.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008912"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He constructed the interior walls of the house with cedar panels, covering both the floor and the ceiling.

Every part was cedar; no stone was visible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008916"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He prepared the inner sanctuary within the house to place there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008917"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The inner sanctuary at the front was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008918"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Solomon covered the interior of the temple with pure gold.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008921"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Each wing of the cherub measured five cubits in length, so that from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing, the total span was ten cubits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008922"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The other cherub also measured ten cubits. Both cherubim were of the same dimensions and identical in size.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008923"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and the other cherub was the same height.</span></p>
