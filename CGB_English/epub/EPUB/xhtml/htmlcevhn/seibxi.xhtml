<h3 class="index-book-title">Job Chapter 42</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013924"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Job responded to the LORD and said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013925"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am aware that you are capable of accomplishing all things, and that no purpose or intention can be hidden from you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013926"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who is this that conceals advice without understanding? Therefore, I have spoken of things I did not comprehend—matters too extraordinary for me, which I did not fully grasp.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013927"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen, I implore you, and I will speak; I will question you, and you must explain to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013928"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have heard reports about you through what others have said, but now my own eyes have seen you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013929"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I despise myself and turn back in deep sorrow, humbled in dust and ashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013930"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the LORD had finished speaking these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013931"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, take with you now seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job. Offer a burnt offering on your own behalf, and my servant Job will pray for you. I will accept his prayer, so that I do not punish you for your foolishness, because you have not spoken rightly about me, as my servant Job has.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013932"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamath went and did as the LORD had instructed them. The LORD also showed favor to Job.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013933"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the LORD restored Job's fortunes when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013934"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then all his brothers and sisters, along with everyone who had known him before, came to him. They shared a meal with him in his home, expressing their sorrow and offering him comfort for all the hardship the LORD had allowed to come upon him. Each of them also gave him a gift of money and a gold earring as a token of their support.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013935"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD blessed Job’s later life even more than his earlier years. He came to possess fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013936"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also had seven sons and three daughters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013937"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He named the first daughter Jemima, the second Kezia, and the third Keren-happuch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013938"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Throughout the entire land, no women were found as beautiful as Job’s daughters. Moreover, their father granted them an inheritance alongside their brothers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013939"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Job lived for another one hundred and forty years. He saw his children, his grandchildren, and even his great-grandchildren—four generations in all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100013940"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Job passed away, having lived a long and fulfilling life.</span></p>
