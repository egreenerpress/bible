<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You shall then say to your son, "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with great power and strength."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD performed extraordinary and severe signs and wonders in Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against all his household, right before our eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD instructed us to follow all these decrees and to revere the LORD our God, for our lasting benefit, so that He might sustain our lives, as He has done to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And it will be considered our righteousness if we are careful to obey all these commandments before the LORD our God, just as He has commanded us.</span></p>
