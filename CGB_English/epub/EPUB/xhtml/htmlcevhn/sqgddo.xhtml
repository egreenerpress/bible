<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He noticed two boats docked by the lake, but the fishermen had stepped away from them and were cleaning their nets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He stepped into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push it out a short distance from the shore. Then he sat down in the boat and began to teach the people from there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Go out into the deeper part of the lake and let down your nets to catch some fish."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon replied to Him, "Teacher, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But because You say so, I will let down the net."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had done this, they caught a huge number of fish, so many that their net began to tear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them. When they arrived, both boats were filled to the point that they began to sink.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' feet and said, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he was utterly amazed, and so were all those with him, at the enormous catch of fish they had taken.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; from now on, you will be catching people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything behind and followed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, when Jesus was in a certain town, a man who was completely covered with leprosy saw Him. The man fell facedown before Jesus and pleaded with Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You have the power to make me clean.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be made clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone, but said, "Go and present yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the news about him spread even more widely, and large crowds gathered to listen to him and to be healed of their illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went away to a secluded place in the wilderness and prayed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One day, as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting nearby. They had come from every town in Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present with him to heal those who were there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, some men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. They tried to find a way to bring him inside and place him before Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025127"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they were unable to find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up onto the roof and lowered him down, along with his mat, through the tiles into the middle of the gathering, right in front of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025128"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025129"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, "Who is this man who speaks such blasphemies? Who has the authority to forgive sins except God alone?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus became aware of their thoughts, he responded by saying to them, "Why are you debating these things in your hearts?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025131"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," (he then said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At once, he stood up in front of them, picked up the mat he had been lying on, and went home, praising God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everyone was astonished and filled with awe. They praised God and said, "We have witnessed extraordinary things today."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He abandoned everything, got up, and followed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Levi hosted a large banquet in his home, and a great number of tax collectors and others gathered to dine with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the scribes and Pharisees complained about His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are ill do."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I did not come to call those who consider themselves righteous, but to call sinners to turn from their ways and seek forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked him, "Why do John's disciples frequently fast and offer prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same, but yours continue to eat and drink?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Can you expect the wedding guests to fast while the bridegroom is still with them?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, a time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and in those days, they will fast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus also told them a parable: "No one sews a piece of new cloth onto an old garment. If they do, the new patch will tear away from the old fabric, making the tear worse. And the new piece won’t match the old garment."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will spill out, and the wineskins will be ruined.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Fresh wine must be poured into new wineskins; in this way, both the wine and the wineskins will be preserved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one who has tasted aged wine immediately desires new wine, for they say, 'The old is superior.'</span></p>
