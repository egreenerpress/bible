<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001174"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt committed offenses against their master, the king of Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001175"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pharaoh became furious with two of his officials: the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001176"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the same place where Joseph was confined.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001177"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to attend to them, and he served them while they remained in custody for some time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Both the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream on the same night. Each man’s dream had its own meaning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph entered their presence in the morning and observed them closely. He noticed that they appeared deeply troubled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He inquired of Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in custody in his master’s house, asking, “Why do you look so troubled today?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to him, “We have each had a dream, but there is no one to interpret them.” Joseph replied, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please, tell me your dreams.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Joseph, saying, "In my dream, there was a vine right in front of me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The vine had three branches, and it appeared as though they were budding. Its blossoms opened up, and the clusters produced ripe grapes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes, squeezed their juice into the cup, and then placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph replied to him, "This is the meaning of the dream: The three branches represent three days."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In just three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will place Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But remember me when things go well for you, and please show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, so that he might release me from this prison.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being thrown into this prison.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the chief baker saw that Joseph's interpretation was favorable, he said to him, "I also had a dream, and in it, there were three baskets of white bread on my head."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the top basket, there were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds came and ate them out of the basket on my head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph replied, "This is the interpretation: The three baskets represent three days."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In three days, Pharaoh will remove you from your position and have you executed by hanging on a tree. Afterward, the birds will feed on your flesh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials. During the celebration, he restored the chief cupbearer and the chief baker to their positions among his servants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he reinstated the chief cupbearer to his former position, and the cupbearer placed the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001195"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the chief baker was executed, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001196"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.</span></p>
