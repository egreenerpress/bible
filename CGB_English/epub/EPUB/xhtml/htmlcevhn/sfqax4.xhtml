<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000874"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man prospered greatly and acquired an abundance of livestock, along with female and male servants, camels, and donkeys.</span></p>
