<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023729"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that moment, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Who is the most important in the kingdom of heaven?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023730"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus called a young child to come to Him and had the child stand among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023731"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you turn away from your current ways and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023732"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, whoever humbles themselves like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023733"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023734"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023735"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things are inevitable, but how terrible it will be for the person through whom they come!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023736"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023737"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is far better for you to enter into life with only one eye than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023738"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Be careful not to look down on any of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels continually see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023739"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Son of Man has come to rescue what was lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023740"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, wonâ€™t he leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go search for the one that has gone astray?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023741"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if he happens to find it, I tell you the truth, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023742"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, it is not the desire of your Father in heaven that even one of these little ones should be lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023743"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, if your brother wrongs you, go and point out his fault privately, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023744"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if he refuses to listen to you, then bring along one or two others, so that every matter may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023745"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If he refuses to listen to them, bring the matter before the congregation. But if he still refuses to listen even to the congregation, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023746"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023747"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you again: If two of you on earth agree together about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023748"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For wherever two or three come together in my name, I am there among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023749"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter approached Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023750"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023751"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a certain king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023752"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he began to settle the accounts, a man was brought before him who owed ten thousand talents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023753"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, since he did not have the means to repay the debt, his master ordered that he, along with his wife, children, and all his possessions, be sold to settle the payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023754"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The servant then fell to the ground and bowed before him, pleading, "Master, please be patient with me, and I will repay everything I owe."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023755"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the master of that servant was filled with compassion, released him, and canceled his debt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023756"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, that same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him, seized him by the throat, and demanded, "Pay back what you owe me!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023757"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his fellow servant fell down at his feet and pleaded with him, saying, "Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023758"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he refused and instead had the man thrown into prison until he could repay the debt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023759"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply troubled. They went and reported everything to their master.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023760"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his master, after summoning him, said to him, "You wicked servant! I forgave you the entire debt because you pleaded with me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023761"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Shouldnâ€™t you also have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023762"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And his master was furious, and handed him over to the jailers until he could repay everything he owed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023763"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, my heavenly Father will also deal with you if you do not sincerely forgive each one of your brothers and sisters for their wrongdoings.</span></p>
