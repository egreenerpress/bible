<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027918"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had thoroughly examined me, they were prepared to release me, since there was no basis for a death sentence in my case.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027920"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, I have summoned you to see you and speak with you, because it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.</span></p>

He continued this from morning until evening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027924"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of the people believed what was being said, while others did not believe.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027928"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, let it be clearly understood by you that Godâ€™s salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen to it.</span></p>
