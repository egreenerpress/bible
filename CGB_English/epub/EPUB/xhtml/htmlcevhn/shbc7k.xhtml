<h3 class="index-book-title">Zechariah Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022949"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I turned and raised my eyes to look, and behold, four chariots were coming out from between two mountains; and the mountains were made of bronze.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022950"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the first chariot were horses of red color, and in the second chariot were horses of black color.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022951"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the third chariot were horses of white, and in the fourth chariot were horses that were dappled and reddish-brown.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022952"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I responded and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What do these things mean, my lord?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022953"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The angel replied to me, "These are the four winds of heaven, which proceed from their station before the Lord of the whole earth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022954"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The black horses among them are heading out toward the northern region; the white horses follow after them; and the speckled horses are moving toward the southern region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022955"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the bay-colored horses went out, eager to travel across the earth. And the Lord said to them, "Go now, and roam throughout the earth." So they went out and traveled back and forth across the earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022956"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he called out to me and spoke, saying, "Look, those who are going to the northern land have brought peace to my spirit in the northern land."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022957"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022958"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Take some of the exiles—specifically Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have returned from Babylon—and on that same day, go to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022959"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Take silver and gold, and fashion crowns, then place them on the head of Joshua, the son of Jozadak, the high priest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022960"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Go and speak to him, saying, "This is what the LORD of hosts declares: Behold, the man whose name is The Branch. He will rise up from his place and will build the temple of the LORD." </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022961"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will be the one to build the temple of the LORD. He will carry the honor and majesty, and he will sit and rule on his throne. He will also serve as a priest on his throne, and there will be a harmonious relationship between these two roles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022962"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowns will belong to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen, the son of Zephaniah, as a lasting memorial in the temple of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022963"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Those who are distant will come and help build the temple of the LORD, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you wholeheartedly obey the voice of the LORD your God.</span></p>
