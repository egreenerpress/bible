<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025590"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then all the tax collectors and sinners came close to him to listen to his teaching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025591"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and even shares meals with them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025592"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He told them this parable, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025593"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep and lose one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one that is lost until you find it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025594"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And when he finds it, he places it on his shoulders, filled with joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025595"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he returns home, he gathers his friends and neighbors and says to them, "Celebrate with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025596"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you that in the same way, there will be great joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025597"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Imagine a woman who has ten silver coins. If she loses one of them, wouldn’t she light a lamp, sweep the entire house, and search carefully until she finds it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025598"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, "Celebrate with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025599"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, I tell you, there is great joy before the angels of God when even one sinner turns away from their wrongdoing and seeks forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025600"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "There was a man who had two sons."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025601"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the younger son said to his father, “Father, give me the share of the estate that belongs to me.” So the father divided his property between them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025602"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Not long after, the younger son gathered all his belongings and set out for a distant land. There, he squandered his wealth in reckless and extravagant living.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had used up all his resources, a severe famine swept through that land, and he found himself in desperate need.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he went and attached himself to a citizen of that region, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025605"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025606"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he finally came to his senses, he said, “How many of my father’s hired workers have more than enough food to eat, while I am here starving to death!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025607"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025608"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired workers."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025609"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025610"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The son said to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025611"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the father said to his servants, “Bring out the finest robe and clothe him with it. Place a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025612"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Go and bring the fattened calf here, slaughter it, and let us feast and celebrate together."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025613"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this son of mine was dead, but now he is alive again; he was lost, but now he is found. And they began to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025614"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, the older son was out in the field. As he returned and approached the house, he heard music and the sound of dancing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025615"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He summoned one of the servants and inquired about the meaning of these events.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025616"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "Your brother has returned, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has welcomed him back safe and unharmed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025617"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The older son became angry and refused to go inside. So his father came out and pleaded with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025618"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The son replied to his father, "Look, for all these years I have served you, and I have never disobeyed your commands. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025619"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But as soon as this son of yours came back—the one who has squandered your wealth with immoral living—you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025620"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "My child, you are always with me, and everything I have belongs to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025621"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It was fitting for us to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and has been found.</span></p>
