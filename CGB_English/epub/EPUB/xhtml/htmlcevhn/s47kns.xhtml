<h3 class="index-book-title">Genesis Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent during the heat of the day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He raised his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed down to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "My Lord, if I have now found favor in your sight, please do not pass by your servant."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Please allow me to bring some water so you may wash your feet, and then rest beneath the tree.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Let me bring you some food to refresh yourselves before you continue your journey, since you have come to your servant for this purpose. They replied, "Do as you have said."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000431"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quickly prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and bake cakes on the hearth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000432"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham hurried to the herd and selected a young, choice calf. He gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000433"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He brought out butter, milk, and the calf he had prepared, and set it before them. Then he stood nearby under the tree while they ate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000434"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?" He replied, "She is there, inside the tent."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000435"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son." Now Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000436"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham and Sarah were both very old, well advanced in years, and Sarah had passed the age of childbearing, as she was no longer experiencing the natural cycles of women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000437"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, "After I have become worn with age, will I truly experience such joy, especially since my husband is also old?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I truly bear a child, even though I am old?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000439"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time, I will return to you, when the season of life has come, and Sarah will have a son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000440"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," because she was afraid. But he replied, "No, you certainly did laugh."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000441"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The men stood up from that place and turned their gaze toward Sodom. Abraham accompanied them to send them on their way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000442"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the LORD said, "Should I conceal from Abraham what I am about to do?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000443"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since Abraham is destined to become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000444"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I have chosen him because he will direct his children and his household after him to follow the way of the LORD, doing what is right and just, so that the LORD may fulfill for Abraham what He has promised concerning him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000445"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is overwhelming, and because their sin is exceedingly severe."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000446"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will go down now and see if their actions fully match the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will understand the truth of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000447"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The men then turned away from that place and headed toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing in the presence of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000448"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham approached and said, "Will you also destroy the righteous along with the wicked?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000449"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Perhaps there are fifty righteous people within the cityâ€”will you also destroy the place and not spare it for the sake of the fifty righteous who are there?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000450"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It would be entirely uncharacteristic of you to act in such a way, to put the righteous to death along with the wicked, treating the righteous as though they were no different from the wicked. Such a thing is far from you! Should not the Judge of all the earth act justly?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000451"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said, "If I find fifty righteous people within the city of Sodom, I will spare the entire place for their sake."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000452"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham responded, saying, "Now, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, even though I am nothing but dust and ashes."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000453"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Perhaps there will be only forty-five righteous people instead of fifty. Will you destroy the entire city because of the lack of five?" And He replied, "If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000454"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he spoke to him once more, saying, "Perhaps forty righteous people will be found there." And he replied, "I will not do it for the sake of forty."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000455"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Please, may the Lord not be angry, and I will speak once more: What if thirty are found there?" He replied, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000456"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Please, I have ventured to speak to the Lord: What if twenty righteous people are found there?" The Lord replied, "I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000457"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Please, may the Lord not be angry, and I will speak just once more: What if ten are found there?" The Lord replied, "I will not destroy it for the sake of ten."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000458"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, He departed. Then Abraham returned to his own place.</span></p>
