<h3 class="index-book-title">Isaiah Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017999"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Trouble awaits the land of whirring wings, the land beyond the rivers of Cush, where messengers swiftly come and go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018000"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Those who send envoys across the sea, in boats made of papyrus reeds upon the waters, saying, 'Go, swift messengers, to a nation scattered and ravaged, to a people feared from their beginning until now; a nation measured out and trampled underfoot, whose land has been devastated by rivers!'</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018001"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All you who live in the world and dwell on the earth, pay attention: when a banner is raised on the mountains, look closely; and when a trumpet is sounded, listen carefully.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018002"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is what the LORD said to me: "I will remain at rest, and I will observe from my dwelling place, like a radiant heat over the plants, and like a refreshing cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018003"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Before the harvest, when the bud has fully formed and the unripe grape is beginning to ripen in the blossom, he will cut off the shoots with pruning tools and remove and cut down the branches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018004"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will be left together as prey for the birds of the mountains and the wild animals of the earth. The birds will feed on them throughout the summer, and all the beasts of the earth will devour them during the winter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018005"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, a gift will be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people who are scattered and oppressed, from a nation feared and dreaded from its beginning until nowâ€”a people who have been measured out and trampled underfoot, whose land has been ravaged by rivers. This offering will be brought to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, to Mount Zion.</span></p>
