<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026728"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have told you these things so that you will not fall away or lose faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026729"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will expel you from the synagogues. Indeed, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will believe they are offering service to God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026730"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will treat you in this way because they have not come to know the Father or me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026731"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have told you these things so that when the time comes, you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you these things from the start, because I was with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026732"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026733"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because I have told you these things, grief has overwhelmed your heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026734"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: It is better for you that I go away. For if I do not leave, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026735"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he comes, he will expose the world’s guilt concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026736"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Concerning sin, because they do not believe in me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026737"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will no longer see me;</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026738"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026739"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"I still have much to tell you, but you are not yet ready to understand it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026740"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak whatever he hears, and he will reveal to you what is to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026741"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will bring me honor, for he will take what is mine and make it known to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026742"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everything that belongs to the Father is also mine. This is why I said that he will take what is mine and reveal it to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026743"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In a short time, you will no longer see me; and then, after a little while, you will see me again, because I am going to the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026744"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some of His disciples said to one another, "What does He mean when He tells us, 'In a little while, you will not see Me, and then after a little while, you will see Me,' and, 'Because I am going to the Father'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026745"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they said, "What does he mean by saying, 'a little while'? We don't understand what he is talking about."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026746"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, aware that they wanted to ask him about this, said to them, "Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, 'In a little while, you will no longer see me, and then after a little while, you will see me again'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026747"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will be transformed into joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026748"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When a woman is in labor, she experiences pain because her time has come. But once she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the suffering, because of the joy that a person has been brought into the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026749"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are now experiencing sorrow, but I will see you again, and your hearts will be filled with joy—a joy that no one can take away from you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026750"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that day, you will no longer need to ask me anything. Truly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026751"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Until now, you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026752"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have spoken these things to you in figurative language, but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in such terms. Instead, I will reveal the Father to you clearly and openly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026753"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that day, you will ask in my name, and I do not need to tell you that I will plead with the Father on your behalf.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026754"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026755"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have come from the Father and entered into the world; now, I am leaving the world and returning to the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026756"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His disciples said to him, "Now you are speaking clearly and not using figurative language."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026757"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now we are certain that you know all things and have no need for anyone to question you. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026758"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, "Do you truly believe now?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026759"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully: the time is coming—in fact, it has already arrived—when you will all be scattered, each going your own way, and you will leave me by myself. Yet I am not truly alone, because the Father is with me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026760"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world, you will face trouble and hardship, but take heart and be courageous; I have conquered the world.</span></p>
