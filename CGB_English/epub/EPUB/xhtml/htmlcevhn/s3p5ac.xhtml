<h3 class="index-book-title">Ezekiel Chapter 35</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021346"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, the message of the LORD came to me, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021347"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Son of man, direct your attention toward Mount Seir and proclaim a message of judgment against it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021348"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And declare to it, "This is what the Lord GOD says: Listen, O Mount Seir, I am against you, and I will raise my hand against you, turning you into a complete wasteland."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021349"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will devastate your cities, and you will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021350"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because you have maintained an enduring hostility and have shed the blood of the people of Israel by the sword during their time of distress, when their sin had reached its culmination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021351"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deliver you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you have not rejected bloodshed, bloodshed will indeed pursue you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021352"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this way, I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, cutting off from it all who come and go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021353"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will cover his mountains with those slain in battle; in your hills, in your valleys, and in all your streams, those killed by the sword will fall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021354"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will make you a perpetual wasteland, and your cities will never be restored. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021355"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because you have declared, "These two nations and these two lands will belong to us, and we will take possession of them," even though the LORD was present there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021356"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will act in accordance with your anger and the jealousy you have shown in your hatred toward them. I will make myself known among them when I pass judgment on you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021357"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will come to understand that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all the scornful words you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, declaring, "They are laid waste; they have been handed over to us to devour."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021358"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have spoken arrogantly against me with your own mouth, and you have piled up your words against me. I have heard it all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021359"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is what the Lord GOD says: When the entire earth is filled with joy, I will bring desolation upon you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021360"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as you rejoiced over the desolation of the house of Israel when they lost their inheritance, so I will do to you: you will become desolate, O Mount Seir, and all of Edomâ€”every part of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</span></p>
