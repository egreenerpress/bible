<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003055"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If someone has a swelling, a scab, or a shiny spot on their skin that resembles the appearance of a leprous disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who serve as priests.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003056"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the body. If the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a sign of leprosy. After examining it, the priest shall declare the person unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003057"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If there is a white spot on someone's skin, and it appears to be no deeper than the skin itself, and the hair in the affected area has not turned white, then the priest must isolate the person with the skin condition for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003058"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. If the skin condition has not changed and the infection has not spread further, the priest must isolate him for another seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003059"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the seventh day, the priest shall examine him again. If the affected area has faded and the infection has not spread on the skin, the priest shall declare him clean; it is only a scab. He must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003060"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if the rash spreads further across the skin after the priest has examined him for his cleansing, he must be examined by the priest once more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003061"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the priest observes that the skin disease has indeed spread across the skin, then the priest must declare the person unclean; it is a case of leprosy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003062"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a person is afflicted with a skin disease, such as leprosy, they must be brought to the priest for examination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003063"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest shall examine him, and if the swelling on the skin appears white, has turned the hair white, and there is fresh, raw flesh in the swelling,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003064"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is a chronic skin disease, a form of leprosy, on his flesh. The priest must declare him unclean; he is not to isolate him, for he is already unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003065"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a skin disease spreads widely across the skin, covering the entire body of the infected person from head to toe, wherever the priest examines it,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003066"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the priest shall examine him, and if he sees that the leprosy has covered the entire body, he shall declare the person clean who has the infection. Since it has all turned white, he is clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003067"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if raw, exposed flesh appears on him, he will be considered unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003068"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest will examine the exposed, raw flesh and declare the person unclean, because the raw flesh is uncleanâ€”it is a sign of leprosy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003069"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the raw flesh heals and turns white again, the person must go to the priest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003070"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest shall examine him, and if the affected area has turned white, the priest shall declare him clean. He is indeed clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003071"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The flesh, including the skin, that has a boil and then heals,</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003073"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the priest examines it, if the affected area appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest must declare the person unclean. It is a case of leprosy that has broken out from the boil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003074"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if the priest examines it and finds no white hairs in it, and if the spot is not deeper than the skin but appears somewhat faded, then the priest shall isolate the person for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003075"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the condition spreads extensively across the skin, the priest must declare the person unclean; it is a contagious skin disease.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003076"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is a scar from a boil; the priest shall then declare him clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003077"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If there is any area of skin that has a severe burn, and the raw, burned flesh develops a bright white spot that appears somewhat reddish or white,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003078"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and the spot appears deeper than the skin, it is a case of leprosy that has broken out from the burn. Therefore, the priest shall declare the person unclean; it is a contagious skin disease of leprosy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003079"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if the priest examines it and finds that there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the surrounding skin but appears somewhat faded, then the priest must isolate the person for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003080"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the seventh day, the priest shall examine him again. If the condition has spread significantly across the skin, the priest must declare him unclean; it is a case of leprosy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003081"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread across the skin, but appears somewhat faded, it is the swelling from a burn. The priest shall then declare the person clean, for it is merely the inflammation of a burn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003082"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a man or woman has a sore or infection on their head or beard,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003083"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The priest shall examine the affected area, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin, with thin yellow hair growing in it, the priest shall declare the person unclean. It is a scaly sore, a form of leprosy on the head or beard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003084"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the priest examines the scaly skin condition and finds that it does not appear deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest must isolate the person with the scaly condition for seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003085"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the affected area. If he observes that the scaly skin condition has not spread, there is no yellowish hair present, and the infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003086"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The person must shave their head, but they must not shave the area affected by the scaly infection. The priest is to isolate the one with the infection for another seven days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003087"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the scaly infection. If the infection has not spread on the skin and does not appear to go deeper than the skin, the priest shall declare the person clean. After this, the person must wash their clothes, and they will be considered clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if the scaly infection spreads further on the skin after he has been pronounced clean,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003089"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the priest shall examine him, and if the scaly patch has spread across the skin, the priest need not look for yellow hair; the person is unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003090"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if the scaly patch remains unchanged in appearance and black hair has grown in it, the condition is healed; the person is clean. The priest shall then declare them clean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003091"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a man or a woman has shiny patches on the skin of their body, patches that are white and shiny,</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100003093"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man who has lost the hair from his head is bald, but he is still considered clean.</span></p>
