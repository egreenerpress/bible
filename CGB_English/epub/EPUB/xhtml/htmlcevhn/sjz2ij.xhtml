<h3 class="index-book-title">Genesis Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000497"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham traveled from there toward the southern region and settled between Kadesh and Shur. He stayed for a time in Gerar as a temporary resident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000498"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent for her and took Sarah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000499"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is another man's wife."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000500"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Abimelech had not approached her, and he said, "Lord, will you destroy a nation that is innocent?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000501"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself also said, ‘He is my brother.’ I acted with integrity in my heart and with innocence in my hands when I did this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000502"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And God spoke to him in a dream, saying, "Yes, I know that you acted with sincerity in your heart, for I also prevented you from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000503"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, therefore, return the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not return her, know for certain that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000504"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Abimelech got up early in the morning and summoned all his servants. He told them everything that had happened, and the men were filled with great fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000505"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you, that you have brought such a great sin upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000506"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see or perceive that led you to do this thing?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000507"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abraham said, "Because I thought to myself, 'Surely there is no reverence for God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000508"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And yet, she is truly my sister; she is the daughter of my father, though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000509"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When God led me to leave my father’s household, I said to her, “This is the favor I ask of you: wherever we go, say of me, ‘He is my brother.’”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000510"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abimelech took sheep, cattle, male servants, and female servants, and gave them to Abraham. He also returned Sarah, Abraham’s wife, to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000511"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you; settle wherever it suits you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000512"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And to Sarah he said, "Listen, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. This is to serve as a public vindication for you in the eyes of all who are with you and before everyone else. By this, you are fully cleared of any wrongdoing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000513"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, enabling them to have children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000514"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</span></p>
