<h3 class="index-book-title">Ruth Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007174"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, should I not seek security for you, so that you may prosper and find well-being?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007175"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now, is not Boaz one of our relatives, with whose young women you have been working? Look, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007176"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, wash yourself, put on perfume, and dress in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know who you are until he has finished eating and drinking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007177"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he lies down, take note of the place where he is resting. Then go in quietly, uncover his feet, and lie down there. He will then tell you what you should do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And she replied to her, "I will do everything you tell me to do."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Boaz had finished eating and drinking, and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the edge of the grain pile. Then Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down beside him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At midnight, the man awoke in fear and turned over, only to find a woman lying at his feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked, "Who are you?" She replied, "I am Ruth, your servant. Please spread the corner of your garment over me, for you are a close relative with the right to redeem."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown greater loyalty now than at the beginning, for you have not pursued younger men, whether they were poor or wealthy."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you everything you have asked, for all the people of my city know that you are a woman of noble character.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now it is indeed true that I am a close relative of yours; however, there is another relative who is closer than I am.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he agrees to fulfill his duty as a kinsman-redeemer for you, then let him do so. But if he is unwilling to act as your kinsman-redeemer, then I swear by the living LORD that I will fulfill that duty for you. Now, lie down and rest until morning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She remained at his feet until morning, but she got up before anyone could recognize another person. Boaz said, "Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also said, "Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she held it open, he measured out six measures of barley and placed it in the shawl. Then she carried it into the city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "Who are you, my daughter?" Ruth then recounted everything that the man had done for her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And she said, "He gave me these six measures of barley, for he told me, 'Do not return to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then she said, "Wait here, my daughter, until you see how this matter turns out. The man will not rest until he has resolved this situation today."</span></p>
