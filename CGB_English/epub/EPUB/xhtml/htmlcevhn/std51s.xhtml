<h3 class="index-book-title">Acts Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026998"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter and John were going up to the temple together at the time of prayer, which was the ninth hour of the day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026999"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a man who had been unable to walk since birth. Every day, he was carried and placed at the temple gate called "Beautiful," so he could beg for money from those entering the temple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027000"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man, seeing Peter and John about to enter the temple, asked them for a gift of charity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027001"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter, fixing his gaze intently on him along with John, said, "Look at us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027002"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He paid close attention to them, anticipating that he would receive something from them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027003"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter said, "I have no silver or gold, but what I do have, I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027004"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He grasped him by the right hand and helped him to stand up. At once, his feet and ankle bones were strengthened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027005"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, leaping to his feet, he stood up and began to walk. He entered the temple with them, walking and jumping, and praising God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027006"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And all the people saw him walking and giving praise to God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027007"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were utterly astonished and filled with amazement at what had happened to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027008"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the man who had been lame and was now healed clung to Peter and John, all the people rushed toward them at the place known as Solomon’s Porch, utterly amazed and filled with wonder.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027009"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Peter saw this, he addressed the people, saying, "Fellow Israelites, why are you amazed at this? Why do you stare at us as though we had made this man walk by our own power or godliness?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027010"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has honored and exalted his servant Jesus. Yet you handed him over to be condemned and rejected him before Pilate, even though Pilate had decided to release him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027011"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and instead asked for a murderer to be released to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027012"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They put to death the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead—a fact to which we bear witness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027013"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Through faith in His name, His name has given strength to this man whom you all see and know. Indeed, the faith that comes through Him has granted this man complete healing, as you can all witness here today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027014"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now, brothers and sisters, I understand that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027015"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the things which God had previously revealed through the words of all His prophets—that the Messiah would suffer—He has now fulfilled in this way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027016"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, turn away from your sins and change your ways, so that your wrongdoings may be wiped away. This will happen when the times of renewal and restoration come from the presence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027017"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he will send Jesus Christ, who was previously proclaimed to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027018"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The heavens must receive him until the time comes for the restoration of all things, as God has declared through the words of all his holy prophets from the beginning of the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027019"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For Moses indeed said to our ancestors, "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your own people, just as He raised me up. You must listen to him in everything he tells you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027020"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And it will happen that every person who refuses to listen to that prophet will be completely cut off from among the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027021"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel onward, and those who came after him, as many as have spoken, have also predicted these days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027022"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are the descendants of the prophets and heirs of the covenant that God established with our ancestors when He said to Abraham, "Through your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God first sent His Son Jesus, whom He raised up, to bring blessing to you by turning each of you away from your sins.</span></p>
