<h3 class="index-book-title">I Corinthians Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028529"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Regarding the matter of food sacrificed to idols, we recognize that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge can lead to pride, but love builds up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028530"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone believes they have knowledge about something, they have not yet come to know it as they truly should.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028531"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if someone truly loves God, that person is recognized and known by Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028532"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Regarding the matter of eating food that has been offered to idols, we understand that an idol has no real existence in the world and that there is no God but one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028534"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For us, there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things originate, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things exist, and we exist through Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028535"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, not everyone possesses this understanding. For some, even now, with their awareness still tied to the idol, eat the food as though it were offered to an idol; and because their conscience is weak, it becomes defiled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028536"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, food does not make us more acceptable to God; for whether we eat or do not eat, it does not make us any better or any worse in His eyes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028537"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Be careful, however, that your freedom does not in any way become a cause for those who are weak in faith to stumble.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028538"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If someone sees you, who possess knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t the conscience of the one who is weak be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028539"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And by your knowledge, will the weaker brother be destroyed, someone for whom Christ died?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028540"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, when you act in such a way that causes your fellow believers to stumble and harms their sensitive conscience, you are not only sinning against them but also against Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028541"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, if eating meat causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never eat meat again as long as the world endures, so that I do not cause them to stumble.</span></p>
