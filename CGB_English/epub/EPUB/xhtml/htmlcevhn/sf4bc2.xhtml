<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026632"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Before the Passover festival, when Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and return to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he showed them the full extent of his love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026633"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the evening meal was finished, the devil had already placed in the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, the intention to betray Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026634"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, fully aware that the Father had entrusted all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026635"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He got up from the meal, removed his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026636"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After this, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026637"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus came to Simon Peter, and Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026638"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded and said to him, "What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will come to know it later."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026639"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus replied, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026640"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not just my feet, but also my hands and my head."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026641"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Those who have bathed only need to wash their feet, for they are completely clean. And you are clean—though not all of you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026642"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he knew who would betray him; that is why he said, "Not all of you are pure."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026643"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had washed their feet, put his outer clothing back on, and returned to his place at the table, he said to them, "Do you understand what I have just done for you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026644"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are right to do so, for that is who I am.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026645"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026646"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I have set an example for you, so that you should do as I have done for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026647"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Truly, truly, I tell you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026648"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you understand these teachings, you will be blessed if you put them into practice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026649"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: "The one who shares my bread has turned against me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026650"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am who I claim to be.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026651"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever welcomes the one I send welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026652"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had spoken these words, he became deeply distressed in spirit and solemnly declared, "Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026653"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the disciples glanced at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026654"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, one of his disciples, whom Jesus deeply loved, was reclining close to him, leaning against his chest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026655"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter then gestured to him, signaling that he should inquire about whom Jesus was speaking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026656"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, leaning close to Jesus, he said to him, "Lord, who is it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026657"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it." Then He dipped the bread and handed it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026658"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you are about to do, do it quickly."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026659"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one sitting at the table understood why he said this to him or what he meant by it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026660"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of them thought, since Judas was in charge of the money bag, that Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026661"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. It was night.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026662"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had left, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026663"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If God is honored through him, God will also honor him in himself, and will immediately bring him honor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026664"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Dear children, I will only be with you a little longer. You will look for me, but just as I told the Jewish leaders, where I am going, you cannot come—so now I say the same to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026665"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am giving you a new commandment: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you must also love one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026666"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">By this, everyone will recognize that you are my followers: if you demonstrate genuine love for one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026667"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me later."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026668"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter said to him, "Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I am ready to give up my life for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026669"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to him, "Are you willing to give up your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I tell you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times."</span></p>
