<h3 class="index-book-title">I Peter Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030401"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, put away all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slanderous speech.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030402"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Like newborn infants, earnestly crave the pure spiritual milk of God's word, so that by it you may grow and mature in your faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030403"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If indeed you have experienced and recognized that the Lord is kind and good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030404"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are coming to Him, who is like a living stone—rejected by people but chosen and honored by God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030405"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You, too, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030406"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is why it is written in Scripture: "Look, I am placing in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious; and whoever believes in him will never be put to shame."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030407"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For those of you who believe, He is of great value and honor. But for those who are disobedient, the stone that the builders rejected has become the most important cornerstone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030408"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And a stone that causes people to trip, and a rock that makes them fall—this is for those who stumble over the message because they refuse to obey. For this is what they were destined to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030409"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people set apart for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030410"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the past, you were not considered a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030411"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Beloved friends, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents in this world to refrain from indulging in sinful desires that wage war against your soul.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030412"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Live in such a way that your conduct is honorable among those who do not share your faith. Even if they accuse you of wrongdoing, let them see your good deeds, so that when the time of God's judgment comes, they may glorify Him because of the way you have lived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030413"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Submit yourselves to every human authority for the sake of the Lord: whether it is to the king, as the highest authority,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030414"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Or to those in authority, as to those appointed by him to bring punishment on those who do wrong and to commend those who do what is right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030415"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is the will of God: that by doing good, you may silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil. Instead, live as servants of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030417"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Respect everyone. Love the community of believers. Revere God. Honor the king.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030418"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with complete respect, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are harsh and difficult.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is commendable if someone, motivated by their conscience toward God, patiently endures hardship and suffers unjustly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What credit is it to you if, when you are punished for your wrongdoing, you endure it patiently? But if, when you do what is right and suffer for it, you endure it patiently, this is commendable in the sight of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this very purpose you were called: because Christ also suffered for us, setting an example for us, so that you should follow in his footsteps.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030422"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He committed no sin, nor was deceit ever found in his speech.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030423"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he was insulted, he did not retaliate with insults; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030424"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He himself carried our sins in his own body on the cross, so that we, having died to sin, might live for righteousness. By his wounds, you have been healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030425"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For you were like sheep who had wandered away, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span></p>
