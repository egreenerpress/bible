<h3 class="index-book-title">Hosea Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I sought to heal Israel, the sin of Ephraim was exposed, and the wickedness of Samaria was revealed. For they practice deceit; thieves break in, and bands of robbers raid in the open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They do not reflect in their hearts that I remember all their evil deeds. Now their own actions have surrounded them; their sins are right before my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They bring joy to the king through their acts of wickedness, and they delight the rulers with their deceitful words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They are all like adulterers, burning with desire like an oven stoked by the baker, who stops stirring the fire once the dough is kneaded, waiting only for it to rise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the day of our king's celebration, the leaders have made him ill by overindulging in wine; he has joined hands with mockers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For their hearts are set like an oven, while they lie in ambush. Their baker sleeps through the night, but in the morning, it blazes like a raging fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They are all inflamed like a blazing oven, and they have consumed their rulers; all their kings have fallen. Not one among them calls out to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Ephraim has mingled himself among the nations; Ephraim is like a half-baked cake.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Foreigners have consumed his resources, and he is unaware of it. Indeed, signs of aging are appearing on him, yet he does not realize it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The arrogance of Israel bears witness against them, yet they refuse to turn back to the LORD their God or seek Him, despite all that has happened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Ephraim is like a senseless dove, lacking understanding: they cry out to Egypt for help, and then turn to Assyria for support.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they go forth, I will cast my net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky; I will discipline them, just as their assembly has been warned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How terrible for them! They have turned away from me. Destruction will come upon them because they have rebelled against me. Even though I rescued and redeemed them, they have spoken deceitfully about me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet they have not called out to me sincerely from their hearts, even as they wail upon their beds. They gather together for grain and wine, but they turn away from me in rebellion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even though I have supported and strengthened their power, they still plot evil against me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022195"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They turn back, but not to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow that fails to shoot true. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their reckless words. This will be their shame in the land of Egypt.</span></p>
