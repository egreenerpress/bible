<h3 class="index-book-title">Ephesians Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029231"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He has made you alive, you who were dead in your transgressions and sins;</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029232"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the past, you lived according to the ways of this world, following the ruler of the domain of the air—the spirit now at work in those who are disobedient.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029233"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the past, all of us lived among them, following the passions and desires of our sinful nature, indulging the cravings of our flesh and our thoughts. By our very nature, we were deserving of God’s wrath, just like everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029234"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But God, who is abundant in mercy, because of the immense love with which he loved us,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029235"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even when we were spiritually dead because of our sins, God made us alive together with Christ—it is by His grace that you have been saved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029236"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He has raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029237"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This was done so that in the ages to come, He might demonstrate the immeasurable riches of His grace, expressed through His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029238"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are saved by grace through faith, and this is not something you have accomplished on your own—it is the gift of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029239"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is not based on works, so that no one can boast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029240"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to live out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029241"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, remember that in the past you were Gentiles by birth, referred to as "the uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcised"—a physical mark made by human hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029242"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, you were separated from Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreign to the covenants of promise. You were without hope and without God in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029243"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once distant have been brought near through the blood of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029244"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he is our peace, the one who has united both groups into one and has dismantled the dividing wall of hostility between us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029245"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">By His physical sacrifice, He eliminated the hostility—the law with its commandments and regulations—so that He might create in Himself one new humanity from the two, thereby establishing peace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029246"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And so that He might bring both groups into unity with God through one body by means of the cross, putting to death the hostility between them through His sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029247"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came and proclaimed peace to those who were far away and to those who were near.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029248"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For through him, both of us have access to the Father by means of one Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029249"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, you are no longer outsiders or foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with God’s holy people and members of God’s own household.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029250"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are being built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ himself as the cornerstone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029251"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Him, the entire structure is joined together harmoniously and grows into a sacred temple in the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029252"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Him, you also are being joined together to become a dwelling place for God through the Spirit.</span></p>
