<h3 class="index-book-title">Galatians Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now I say this: As long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a servant, even though he is the owner of everything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, he remains under the supervision of guardians and managers until the time set by his father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, when we were spiritually immature, we were enslaved to the basic principles and forces of this world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the appointed time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the authority of the law,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To rescue those who were under the authority of the law, so that we might be granted the status of adopted children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because you are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, calling out, "Abba, Father."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a child; and since you are a child, you are also an heir of God through Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, at that time, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that are not truly gods by their very nature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now, since you have come to know God—or rather, have been known by God—how can you turn back again to those weak and worthless principles? Why would you desire to be enslaved by them once more?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are paying special attention to certain days, months, seasons, and years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am concerned for you, fearing that I may have labored among you for nothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Brothers and sisters, I urge you to become like me, for I have become like you. You have done me no wrong.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware that it was because of a physical ailment that I first proclaimed the gospel to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You did not scorn or reject me because of the trial I faced in my physical condition. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, even as though I were Christ Jesus himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So where is that sense of blessing you once spoke of? I can testify about you that, if it had been possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029148"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Have I now become your enemy simply because I am telling you the truth?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029149"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They show great enthusiasm for you, but their intentions are not genuine. In fact, they seek to isolate you so that you will focus your attention and devotion on them instead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029150"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is commendable to be deeply committed to a noble cause at all times, not just when I am with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029151"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">My dear children, for whom I labor in anguish once more until Christ is fully formed within you,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029152"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I wish I could be with you right now and adjust the tone of my message, because I am deeply concerned about you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029153"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Tell me, you who wish to be subject to the law, do you not understand what the law says?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029154"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is written that Abraham had two sons: one born to a servant woman and the other to a free woman.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029155"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the child born from the slave woman was conceived through ordinary human means, while the child born from the free woman was the result of God's promise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029156"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These things are symbolic: they represent two covenants. One covenant comes from Mount Sinai and leads to slavery—this is represented by Hagar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029157"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029158"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the heavenly Jerusalem is free, and she is the mother of us all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029159"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is written: "Rejoice, you who are barren and do not bear children; burst into song and shout for joy, you who are not in labor! For the woman who was desolate will have more children than the one who has a husband."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029160"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, brothers and sisters, just like Isaac, we are children of the promise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029161"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is also now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029162"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But what does the scripture say? "Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029163"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the enslaved woman, but of the free woman.</span></p>
