Bring the staff you used to strike the Nile River, hold it in your hand, and go."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001990"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully: I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb. When you strike the rock, water will flow out of it, and the people will be able to drink. Moses did exactly as he was told, in the presence of the elders of Israel.</span></p>
