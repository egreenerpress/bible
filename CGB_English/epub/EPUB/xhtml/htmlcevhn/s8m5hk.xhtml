Whatever they declare in faith will come to pass.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024665"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I tell you this: Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span></p>
