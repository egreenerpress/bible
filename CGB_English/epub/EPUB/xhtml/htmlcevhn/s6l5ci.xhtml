<h3 class="index-book-title">Acts Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027706"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Men, brothers, and fathers, listen to the defense I now present to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027707"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they heard him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they became even more silent. Then he said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027708"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, but I was raised in this city and educated under Gamaliel, being thoroughly instructed in the precise ways of the law of our ancestors. I was deeply devoted to God, just as all of you are today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027709"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I pursued this movement to the point of death, arresting and imprisoning both men and women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027710"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The high priest himself can testify to this, as can the entire council of elders. From them, I received letters addressed to the brothers and sisters in Damascus, and I traveled there to bring those who were bound back to Jerusalem to face punishment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027711"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As I was traveling and approaching Damascus around midday, suddenly a brilliant light from heaven flashed all around me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027712"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027713"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I replied, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said to me, "I am Jesus of Nazareth, the one you are persecuting."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027714"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people who were with me certainly saw the light and were terrified, but they did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027715"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I responded, "What should I do, Lord?" The Lord answered me, "Get up and go to Damascus. There, you will be told everything that has been assigned for you to do."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027716"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And because I was blinded by the overwhelming brightness of that light, I was led by the hand of those who were with me, and so I arrived in Damascus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027717"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law, who was highly respected by all the Jewish people living in that area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027718"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came to me, stood before me, and said, “Brother Saul, regain your sight.” At that very moment, I looked up and saw him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027719"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "The God of our ancestors has chosen you to understand His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the words spoken from His own mouth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027720"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For you will be his witness to all people, testifying to what you have seen and heard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027721"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why are you delaying now? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027722"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a visionary state.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027723"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I saw Him saying to me, "Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027724"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I said, "Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027725"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the blood of your martyr Stephen was spilled, I was there, standing by and approving of his execution. I even guarded the clothing of those who killed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027726"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to me, "Go, for I will send you far away to the nations."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027727"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd listened to him up to this point, but then they raised their voices and shouted, "Get rid of this man from the earth! He doesn’t deserve to live!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027728"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they shouted loudly, they tore off their garments and threw dust into the air.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027729"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The commanding officer ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks and instructed that he be interrogated by flogging, so that he might discover the reason why the crowd was shouting so vehemently against him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027730"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were tying him up with straps, Paul said to the centurion standing nearby, "Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and has not been found guilty?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027731"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the centurion heard this, he went and informed the commanding officer, saying, "Be careful what you do, for this man is a Roman citizen."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027732"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the commanding officer approached and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" He replied, "Yes, I am."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027733"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The commander replied, "I acquired this citizenship at a great cost." But Paul said, "I was born a citizen."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027734"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, those who were about to interrogate him stepped away. The commander also became alarmed when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him with chains.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027735"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, because he wanted to know the exact reason why the Jews had accused him, he released Paul from his chains and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and presented him before them.</span></p>
