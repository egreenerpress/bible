<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026051"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man was sent by God, and his name was John.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026052"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This man came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might come to believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026053"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was not the Light himself, but he was sent to testify about the Light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026054"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This was the genuine Light, which enlightens every person who comes into the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026055"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was present in the world, and the world was created through him, yet the world did not recognize him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026056"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026057"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To all who welcomed him and put their trust in his name, he granted the authority to become children of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026058"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These were born not through human descent, nor by human desire or effort, but through the will and power of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026059"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026060"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John testified about Him and proclaimed, saying, "This is the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks above me, because He existed before me.'"</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026062"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026063"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one has ever seen God at any time; the only Son, who is intimately close to the Father, has made him known.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026064"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the account of John, when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to question him, saying, "Who are you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026067"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him, "Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026068"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "I am the voice of one calling out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026069"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The individuals who were sent belonged to the Pharisees.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026070"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They questioned him, saying, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026071"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John responded to them, saying, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not recognize."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026072"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the one who comes after me, yet surpasses me in importance, and I am not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026073"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These events took place in Bethany on the far side of the Jordan River, where John was performing baptisms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026074"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The following day, John saw Jesus approaching him and declared, "Look, here is the Lamb of God, who removes the sin of the world!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026075"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the one about whom I said, "After me comes a man who surpasses me, because he existed before me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026076"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I did not recognize him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was so that he might be revealed to Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026077"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John testified, saying, "I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained upon him."</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026084"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Come and see."

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</span></p>
