<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024056"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus had finished speaking all these things, he said to his disciples,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024057"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware that in two days the Passover festival will take place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024058"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders of the people gathered together at the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024059"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They conspired together, seeking a way to arrest Jesus by deceit and put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024060"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they replied, "Not during the festival, or there might be a riot among the people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024061"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024062"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A woman approached him carrying an alabaster jar filled with extremely costly perfume. As he was reclining at the table, she poured the perfume over his head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024063"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When his disciples saw this, they were upset and said, "Why this waste? What purpose does it serve?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024064"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money and the proceeds given to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024065"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus became aware of the situation, he said to them, "Why are you causing trouble for this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024066"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024067"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For by pouring this perfume on my body, she has prepared me for burial.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024068"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed throughout the entire world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024069"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of the twelve disciples, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024070"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?" And they agreed to pay him thirty pieces of silver.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024071"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And from that moment on, he began looking for the right opportunity to betray him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024072"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024073"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I will celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024074"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024075"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When evening arrived, He sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024076"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024077"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were deeply distressed, and each one began to ask Him, "Lord, is it me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024078"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus replied, "The one who dips his hand into the bowl with me will be the one to betray me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024079"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Son of Man will go as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024080"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Judas, the one who would betray Him, responded and said, "Teacher, surely it is not I?" Jesus replied to him, "You have said it yourself."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024081"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it; this is my body."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024082"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024083"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024084"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew with you in the kingdom of my Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024085"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024086"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will fall away because of me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024087"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter replied to Him, "Even if everyone else turns away from You because of this, I will never turn away."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024089"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024090"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And all the other disciples said the same.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024091"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Stay here while I go over there to pray."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024092"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him and began to feel deeply distressed and overwhelmed with sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024093"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024094"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went a little farther, fell facedown, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I desire, but as you will.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024095"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Is it really possible that you couldn’t stay awake with me for even one hour?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024096"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stay alert and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024097"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me unless I drink it, may your will be done."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024098"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He returned and found them asleep once more, for their eyes were weighed down with weariness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024099"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left them once more, went away again, and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024100"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Sleep now and take your rest. But look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of sinners."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024101"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Get up, let us go. Look, the one who is betraying me is approaching."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024102"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was still speaking, suddenly Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024103"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, "The man I kiss is the one; seize him and hold him securely."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024104"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, he approached Jesus and said, "Greetings, Teacher," and kissed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?" Then they approached, seized Jesus, and took him into custody.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024107"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who take up the sword will die by the sword."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you think that I cannot at this moment pray to my Father, and He would immediately send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But how then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, which declare that it must happen this way?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that very moment, Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as though I were a criminal? Day after day, I sat with you teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me then."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All of this took place so that the words of the prophets as recorded in Scripture might be fulfilled. At that point, all the disciples abandoned him and fled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter followed him at a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. He entered and sat down with the servants to see how things would turn out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The chief priests, the elders, and the entire council sought false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they found none; indeed, though many false witnesses came forward, they could not find any. Finally, two false witnesses came forward.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you have no response? What is the testimony these witnesses are bringing against you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">63 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest spoke and said to him, "I solemnly charge you by the living God: tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">64 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "You have said it yourself. Yet I tell you this: from now on, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of divine power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">65 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy for yourselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">66 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What is your opinion? They replied, saying, "He deserves to die."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">67 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">68 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Tell us who it was that struck you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">69 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard of the palace when a servant girl approached him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">70 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, "I do not understand what you are talking about."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">71 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he went out to the porch, another servant girl saw him and said to those standing nearby, "This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024127"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">72 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he denied it, swearing, "I do not know the man."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024128"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">73 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After some time, those who were standing nearby approached him and said to Peter, "You must certainly be one of them, because your accent gives you away."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024129"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">74 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the man!" And immediately, the rooster crowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">75 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter recalled the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Overwhelmed with grief, he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></p>
