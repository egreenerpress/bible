<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026212"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After this, there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026213"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five covered walkways.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026214"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In that place lay a large number of people who were disabled—some blind, some lame, and some paralyzed—all waiting for the water to be stirred.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026215"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At a specific time, an angel would descend into the pool and stir the water. Whoever stepped into the pool first after the water was stirred would be healed of whatever disease they had.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026216"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a man there who had been suffering from an illness for thirty-eight years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026217"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had been in that condition for a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be made well?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026218"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disabled man replied, "Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get there, someone else always steps in ahead of me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026219"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026220"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At once, the man was completely healed. He picked up his mat and began to walk. Now, this took place on the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026221"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders then said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath; it is not permitted for you to carry your mat.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026222"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied to them, "The one who healed me told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026223"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him, "Who is the man who told you, 'Pick up your mat and walk'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026224"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was gathered in that place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026225"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Later, Jesus found the man in the temple and said to him, "Look, you have been healed. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026226"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man left and informed the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him completely.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026227"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, the Jewish leaders persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had performed these acts on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026228"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus responded to them, "My Father has been working up to this very moment, and I also am working."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026229"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As a result, the Jewish leaders sought even more intensely to kill him, not only because he had violated the Sabbath, but also because he claimed that God was his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026230"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus responded and said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does the same in the same way."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026231"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Father loves the Son and reveals to Him everything that He Himself does. And He will show Him even greater works than these, so that you may be filled with wonder.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026232"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he chooses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026233"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Father does not judge anyone, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026234"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All people should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026235"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever listens to my message and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life. They will not be condemned but have already passed from death to life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026236"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, the time is coming—indeed, it is already here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will live.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026237"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as the Father possesses life within Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life within Himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026238"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He has granted Him the authority to carry out judgment, because He is the Son of Man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026239"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be amazed at this, for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026240"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they will come forth—those who have done what is good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done what is evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026241"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am not able to do anything on my own authority; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek to carry out my own will but the will of the Father who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026242"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026243"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony he gives concerning me is true.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026244"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026245"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I do not accept human testimony as my validation; rather, I speak these things so that you may be saved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026246"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was a radiant and blazing torch, and for a time you were eager to delight in his light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026247"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about me, proving that the Father has sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026248"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Father Himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form at any time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026249"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You do not have his word dwelling within you, because you do not believe in the one he has sent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026250"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Study the Scriptures diligently, for in them you believe you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026251"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet you refuse to come to me so that you may have life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026252"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I do not accept or seek praise from human beings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026253"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I am aware that you do not have the love of God within you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026254"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. Yet if someone else comes in their own name, you will welcome them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026255"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How can you truly believe when you accept praise and recognition from one another, yet do not seek the honor that comes solely from God?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026256"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not imagine that I will bring charges against you before the Father. There is already one who accuses you—Moses, the very one in whom you place your trust.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026257"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you had truly believed Moses, you would have believed in me as well, because he wrote about me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026258"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if you do not believe what he has written, how will you believe what I say?</span></p>
