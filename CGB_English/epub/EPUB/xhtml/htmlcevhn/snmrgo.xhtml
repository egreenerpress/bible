<h3 class="index-book-title">II Samuel Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008024"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Saul’s death, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites and had stayed in Ziklag for two days,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008025"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the third day, a man arrived from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he approached David, he fell to the ground and bowed in reverence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008026"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David asked him, "Where have you come from?" The man replied, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008027"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David asked him, "What happened? Please, tell me." The man replied, "The troops have fled from the battle, and many of them have fallen and died. Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008028"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David asked the young man who brought him the news, "How do you know for certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008029"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The young man who reported to him said, "As I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, I saw Saul leaning on his spear, and just then, the chariots and horsemen were closing in on him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008030"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he turned and saw me, he called out to me. I responded, "I am here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008031"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he asked me, "Who are you?" I replied, "I am an Amalekite."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008032"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to me again, "Please, stand over me and kill me, for I am overwhelmed with agony, yet my life still lingers within me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008033"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So I stood over him and killed him, because I was certain he could not survive after he had fallen. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008034"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then David grasped his clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008035"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They grieved deeply, weeping and fasting until evening for Saul, for Jonathan his son, for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel, because they had been struck down by the sword.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008036"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David asked the young man who had brought him the news, "Where are you from?" The young man replied, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008037"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David said to him, "How could you not fear to raise your hand to kill the Lord’s anointed one?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008038"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David summoned one of his young men and said, "Step forward and strike him down." The young man approached and struck him, causing his death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008039"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David said to him, "Your blood is on your own head, for your own words have condemned you. You admitted, 'I have killed the Lord's anointed.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008040"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David mourned deeply and composed this lamentation for Saul and for his son Jonathan:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008041"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also instructed them to teach the people of Judah how to use the bow. Indeed, this is recorded in the Book of Jasher.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008042"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The glory of Israel lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008043"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not announce this in Gath, nor proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the women of the Philistines celebrate, and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult in triumph.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008044"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">O mountains of Gilboa, may no dew or rain fall upon you, nor may your fields yield offerings. For there the shield of the mighty was disgracefully cast aside—the shield of Saul, as though he had never been anointed with oil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008045"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From the blood of the fallen, from the strength of the mighty, Jonathan’s bow never retreated, and Saul’s sword never returned without fulfilling its purpose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008046"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Saul and Jonathan were beloved and cherished in their lives, and in their death they were not separated. They were swifter than eagles and mightier than lions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008047"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who provided you with scarlet garments and luxurious adornments, who embellished your clothing with ornaments of gold.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008048"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How the mighty have fallen in the heat of battle! O Jonathan, you were killed on your heights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008049"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am deeply grieved for you, my brother Jonathan. You were a great joy to me, and your love for me was extraordinary, surpassing even the love of women.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008050"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How the mighty have fallen, and the instruments of war have been destroyed!</span></p>
