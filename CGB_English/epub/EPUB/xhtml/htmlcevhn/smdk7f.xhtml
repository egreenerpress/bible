<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027309"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The apostles and fellow believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the message of God.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027311"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were saying, "You went in to visit uncircumcised men and even ate with them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027312"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter explained the entire matter from the start, presenting it to them in an orderly manner, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027313"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was in the city of Joppa, praying, when I fell into a trance and saw a vision. A kind of container, like a large sheet, was being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027314"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I fixed my gaze upon it, I observed and saw four-legged animals of the earth, wild animals, crawling creatures, and birds of the air.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027315"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I heard a voice saying to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027316"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I replied, "Certainly not, Lord! For nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027317"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the voice spoke to me again from heaven, saying, "Do not consider unclean what God has made clean."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027318"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This occurred three times, and each time everything was brought back up into heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027319"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, three men arrived at the house where I was staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027320"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Spirit instructed me to go with them without hesitation. Additionally, these six brothers came with me, and we entered the man’s house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027321"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He explained to us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, "Send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027322"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who will speak to you words by which you and your entire household will be saved?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027323"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came upon them, just as it had come upon us at the start.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027324"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I recalled the words of the Lord, how He had said, "John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since God has given them the same gift as he gave to us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God’s way?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they heard these things, they fell silent and praised God, saying, "So then, God has also granted to the Gentiles the opportunity to repent and receive life."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now those who had been scattered due to the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, proclaiming the message of the gospel, but they spoke only to Jews.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene. When they arrived in Antioch, they began speaking to the Greek-speaking people there, proclaiming the message about the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The power of the Lord was present among them, and a large number of people came to believe and turned their hearts to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">News of these events reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he arrived and witnessed the grace of God at work, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain steadfastly devoted to the Lord with unwavering resolve.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he was a virtuous man, filled with the Holy Spirit and strong in faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to search for Saul.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For an entire year, they gathered with the church and taught many people. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">During that time, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and, moved by the Spirit, foretold that a severe famine would spread over the entire world. This prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius Caesar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the disciples, each according to their own means, decided to send aid to the fellow believers living in Judea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did as instructed and sent the aid to the elders through Barnabas and Saul.</span></p>
