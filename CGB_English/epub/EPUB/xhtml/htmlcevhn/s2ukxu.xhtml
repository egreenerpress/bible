<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026525"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man named Lazarus, from Bethany—the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived—was sick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026526"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This refers to Mary, the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who became ill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026527"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So his sisters sent a message to him, saying, "Lord, the one you love is ill."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026528"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus heard this, he said, "This illness will not end in death, but it is for the purpose of bringing glory to God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026529"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Jesus had a deep affection for Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026530"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026531"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After this, he said to his disciples, "Let us return to Judea."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026532"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His disciples said to him, "Teacher, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "Are there not twelve hours in the daylight? If someone walks during the day, they do not stumble, because they see the light of this world."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026534"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if someone walks in the darkness, they will stumble, because there is no light within them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026535"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying these things, Jesus told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him from his sleep."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026536"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his disciples said, "Lord, if he is sleeping, he will recover."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026537"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, Jesus was speaking about his death, but they thought he was referring to taking a rest in sleep.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026538"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus has died."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026539"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may come to believe. But now, let us go to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026540"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026541"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus arrived, he discovered that the man had already been in the tomb for four days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026542"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026543"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many of the Jewish people came to Martha and Mary to offer them comfort regarding their brother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026544"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Martha heard that Jesus was approaching, she went out to meet him, but Mary remained seated in the house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026545"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026546"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I am certain that even now, whatever you ask of God, God will grant it to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026547"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026548"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026549"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, even if they die, will live."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026550"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whoever lives and believes in me will never experience eternal death. Do you believe this?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026551"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I believe that You are the Messiah, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026552"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After she had spoken these words, she left and privately called her sister Mary, saying, "The Teacher has arrived and is asking for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026553"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Upon hearing this, she immediately got up and went to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026554"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026555"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026556"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026557"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly distressed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026558"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he asked, "Where have you laid him?" They replied, "Lord, come and see."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026559"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus shed tears.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026560"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jewish people said, "Look how deeply he loved him!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026561"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have also prevented this man from dying?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026562"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, deeply moved within himself once more, went to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026563"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by now there will be a bad odor, for he has been dead four days."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026564"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026565"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they removed the stone from the place where the dead man had been laid. Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026566"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the sake of the people standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026567"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying these things, he called out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026568"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man who had been dead came out, his hands and feet still wrapped in burial cloths, and his face covered with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Unbind him and let him go."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026569"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary and witnessed the works Jesus had done came to believe in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026570"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026571"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a meeting and said, "What should we do? This man is performing many miraculous signs."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026572"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026573"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You understand nothing at all."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026574"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not realize that it is better for one man to die for the sake of the people, so that the entire nation may not be destroyed?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026575"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He did not say this on his own authority, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026576"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And this was not only for that nation, but also so that He might unite into one body all the children of God who are scattered throughout the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026577"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From that day onward, they conspired together to put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026578"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As a result, Jesus no longer moved openly among the Jewish people. Instead, he left that place and went to a region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026579"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish Passover was approaching, and many people traveled from the countryside to Jerusalem before the festival to undergo the necessary purification rituals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026580"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they began looking for Jesus and talking among themselves as they stood in the temple, saying, "What do you think? Will he not come to the festival?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026581"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order that if anyone knew where Jesus was, they should report it so that He could be arrested.</span></p>
