<h3 class="index-book-title">Ezekiel Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020494"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to me, "Mortal, stand up on your feet, and I will speak to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020495"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Spirit came into me as he spoke to me, and he caused me to stand on my feet, so that I could hear him speaking to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020496"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation that has rebelled against Me. They and their ancestors have turned away from Me and continued in their disobedience up to this very day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020497"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They are shameless and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, "This is what the Lord GOD says."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020498"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whether they choose to listen or refuse to listen—for they are a defiant and rebellious people—they will still come to know that a prophet has been among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020499"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of what they say, even though you are surrounded by thorns and briers and live among scorpions. Do not be intimidated by their words or discouraged by their hostile looks, even though they are a rebellious people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020500"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are to speak my words to them, whether they choose to listen or refuse to listen, for they are deeply rebellious.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020501"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious people. Open your mouth and receive what I am giving you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020502"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As I looked, I saw a hand reaching out to me, and in it was a scroll.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020503"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He unfolded it before me, and it was covered with writing on both sides. Written upon it were words of sorrow, grief, and despair.</span></p>
