<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024366"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They crossed over to the other side of the sea and arrived in the region of the Gadarenes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024367"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as He stepped out of the boat, a man possessed by an unclean spirit came out from the tombs and met Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024368"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him, not even with chains.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024369"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles shattered into pieces; no one was able to subdue him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024370"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Day and night, he remained in the mountainous regions and among the burial caves, wailing and gashing himself with stones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024371"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he noticed Jesus in the distance, he ran to him and bowed down in reverence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024372"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he shouted with a loud voice, saying, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you by God, do not torment me!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024373"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For He said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024374"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, because we are many."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024375"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he earnestly pleaded with him, begging that he would not send them away from the region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024376"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, near the mountains, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024377"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And all the demons pleaded with Him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter into them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024378"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, Jesus granted them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs, and the entire herd—about two thousand in number—rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024379"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people who were tending the pigs ran away and reported what had happened in the town and the surrounding countryside. Then the people came out to see for themselves what had taken place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024380"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by demons—the one who had been controlled by the legion of evil spirits—now sitting there, fully clothed, and in his right mind. And they were filled with fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024381"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Those who witnessed the event described what had happened to the man who had been possessed by the demon, as well as the incident involving the pigs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024382"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they began to plead with Him to leave their region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024383"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus got into the boat, the man who had been tormented by the demon begged to stay with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024384"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, Jesus did not permit him but said to him, "Go back to your home and to your friends, and tell them all the great things the Lord has done for you and how He has shown you mercy."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024385"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he left and began to proclaim throughout the region of Decapolis all the remarkable things Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard was amazed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024386"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he stayed near the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024387"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, approached. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024388"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He earnestly pleaded with Him, saying, "My young daughter is at the brink of death. I beg You, come and place Your hands on her so that she may be healed and live."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024389"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed, pressing closely around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024390"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A woman who had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years...</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024391"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She had endured much under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of improving, her condition only grew worse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024392"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024393"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For she had said, "If I can just touch his clothing, I will be healed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024394"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, the flow of her blood stopped, and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of her affliction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024395"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus, instantly aware within himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my garments?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024396"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing around You, and yet You ask, 'Who touched Me?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024397"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He turned and looked around to see the woman who had done this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024398"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman, filled with fear and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came forward and fell down before him. She told him the whole truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024399"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be free from your suffering."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024400"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While he was still speaking, some people came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, "Your daughter has died. Why bother the Teacher any further?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024401"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as Jesus heard what was said, he turned to the synagogue leader and said, "Do not be afraid; just trust."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024402"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024403"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, he saw the commotion, with people weeping and wailing loudly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024404"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he entered, he said to them, "Why are you causing such a commotion and weeping? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024405"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They ridiculed him with scorn. But after he had sent them all outside, he took the girl’s father and mother, along with those who were with him, and went into the room where the girl was lying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024406"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the young girl by the hand and said to her, "Talitha cumi," which means, "Young girl, I say to you, get up."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024407"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, the young girl got up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed and filled with overwhelming astonishment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024408"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He strictly instructed them that no one should be told about it, and he directed that she be given something to eat.</span></p>
