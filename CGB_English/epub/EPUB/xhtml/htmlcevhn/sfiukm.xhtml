<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023702"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023703"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was transformed before them: his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became as bright as light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023704"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023705"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter responded and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is wonderful for us to be here. If you are willing, let us set up three shelters here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023706"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I take great delight. Listen to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023707"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground and were overwhelmed with fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023708"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus approached them, touched them, and said, "Get up, and do not be afraid."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023709"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023710"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were descending from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Do not tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023711"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023712"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus responded, saying to them, "Elijah will indeed come first and restore all things."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023713"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you this: Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him. Instead, they did to him whatever they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023714"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the disciples realized that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023715"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived at the crowd, a man approached Him, knelt before Him, and said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023716"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Lord, have mercy on my son, for he suffers from seizures and is severely tormented. He often falls into the fire and frequently into the water.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023717"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I brought him to your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023718"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus responded, saying, "You unbelieving and corrupt generation, how much longer must I remain with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring the boy here to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023719"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus sternly commanded the demon to leave, and it came out of the boy. From that very moment, the child was completely healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023720"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and asked, "Why were we unable to drive it out?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023721"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied to them, "It is because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith even as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023722"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, this kind [of demon] does not come out except through prayer and fasting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023723"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to the power of men."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023724"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will put him to death, but on the third day he will be raised to life. And they were deeply grieved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023725"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023726"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Yes." And when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes or tribute—from their own children or from outsiders?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023727"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter said to him, "From outsiders." Jesus replied to him, "Then the children are exempt."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023728"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, to avoid causing offense, go to the sea, cast a hook, and catch the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a coin. Take that and give it to them for both me and you.</span></p>
