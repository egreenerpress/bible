<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000930"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob continued on his journey, and the angels of God came to meet him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000931"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's army." So he named that place Mahanaim.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000932"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the territory of Edom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000933"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he instructed them, saying, "This is what you shall say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says this: I have been living with Laban and have stayed there until now.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000934"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I possess oxen, donkeys, flocks, and both male and female servants. I have sent this message to inform my lord, hoping to find favor in your sight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000935"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The messengers returned to Jacob and reported, "We went to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, accompanied by four hundred men."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000936"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jacob became very afraid and deeply troubled. So he divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two separate groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000937"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "If Esau attacks one group and overcomes it, the remaining group will have a chance to escape."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000938"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, 'Go back to your homeland and to your relatives, and I will make things go well for you.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000939"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am not deserving of even the smallest portion of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown to your servant. When I crossed this Jordan River, I had nothing but my staff, and now I have grown into two large groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000940"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Rescue me, I beg you, from the power of my brother, from the power of Esau, for I am afraid of him. I fear he may come and attack me, along with the mothers and their children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000941"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You declared, "I will certainly bring you good and make your descendants as numerous as the sand by the sea, so many that they cannot be counted."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000942"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">That same night, he stayed there and selected from what he had with him a gift for his brother Esau.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000943"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000944"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Thirty female camels with their young, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten young donkeys.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000945"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He entrusted them to his servants, dividing them into separate herds. Then he instructed his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep a distance between each herd."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000946"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he instructed the lead servant, saying, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose animals are these ahead of you?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000947"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then you shall say, "They belong to your servant Jacob; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau. And, indeed, he himself is coming behind us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000948"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he instructed the second, the third, and all the others who followed the herds, saying, "This is what you are to say to Esau when you meet him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000949"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you should also say, "Your servant Jacob is coming behind us." For he thought, "I will try to calm him with the gift that is sent ahead of me, and then I will see his face. Perhaps he will show me favor."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000950"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The gifts went on ahead of him, but he stayed that night with the group.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000951"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">That night, he got up and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and they crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000952"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all that he possessed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000953"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000954"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the man realized that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched the socket of Jacobâ€™s hip, and immediately the socket of his hip was dislocated as they continued to wrestle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000955"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But he replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000956"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Jacob."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000957"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with people, and you have prevailed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000958"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob then asked him, saying, "Please, tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask for my name?" And there, he blessed Jacob.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000959"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob named that place Peniel, saying, "It is because I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000960"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he crossed over Penuel, the sun rose upon him, and he was limping because of his hip.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000961"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, to this day, the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacobâ€™s hip was struck at the tendon when he wrestled with the divine being.</span></p>
