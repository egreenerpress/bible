<h3 class="index-book-title">I Samuel Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007278"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The young Samuel served the LORD under Eli’s guidance. In those days, messages from the LORD were rare, and visions from Him were uncommon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007279"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, when Eli had gone to lie down in his usual place, his eyesight had grown so dim that he could no longer see clearly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007280"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Before the lamp of God in the temple of the LORD—where the ark of God was kept—had gone out, Samuel had already lain down to sleep.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007281"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD called to Samuel, and he responded, "I am here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007282"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The boy ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli replied, "I did not call you; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007283"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, the LORD called out, "Samuel!" Samuel got up and went to Eli, saying, "Here I am, for you called me." But Eli replied, "I did not call you, my son. Go back and lie down again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007284"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, Samuel had not yet come to know the LORD intimately, nor had the word of the LORD been disclosed to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007285"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD called Samuel a third time. Samuel got up and went to Eli, saying, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007286"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, Eli said to Samuel, "Go and lie down. If He calls you again, you must say, 'Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007287"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD appeared, stood there, and called out as before, "Samuel, Samuel!" Samuel responded, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007288"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Samuel, "Listen, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring with astonishment."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007289"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that day, I will carry out everything I have declared concerning Eli’s family. When I begin, I will also bring it to completion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007290"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I have declared to him that I will bring judgment upon his household forever because of the sin he is aware of; for his sons acted wickedly, and he did not restrain them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007291"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I have solemnly declared concerning the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli’s family will never be atoned for, not by sacrifice or offering, forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007292"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Samuel remained there until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007293"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Eli called to Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel replied, "I am here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007294"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "What is the message that the LORD has spoken to you? Please, do not keep it from me. May God deal severely with you, and even more so, if you hide anything from me about all that He has told you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007295"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Samuel explained everything to him fully, withholding nothing. Then he said, "It is the LORD's doing; let Him do what He deems right."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007296"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Samuel grew, the LORD was with him, and He ensured that none of Samuel’s words went unfulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007297"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And all of Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, recognized that Samuel had been confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100007298"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD appeared once more in Shiloh, for He made Himself known to Samuel there through His word.</span></p>
