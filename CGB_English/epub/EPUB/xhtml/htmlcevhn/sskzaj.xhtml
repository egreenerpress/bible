<h3 class="index-book-title">I Corinthians Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028602"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I commend you, my brothers and sisters, for keeping me in your thoughts in all matters and for holding firmly to the traditions just as I passed them on to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I want you to understand this clearly: Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028605"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When any man prays or prophesies with his head covered, he dishonors his head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028606"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, any woman who prays or speaks a message from God with her head uncovered brings shame upon herself, for it is just as if her head were shaved.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028607"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a woman does not cover her head, she should also have her hair cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, then she should cover her head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028608"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man should not cover his head, because he is the image and reflection of God’s glory. However, the woman is the reflection of the man’s glory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028609"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man was not created from the woman, but the woman was created from the man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028610"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man was not created for the sake of the woman, but the woman was created for the sake of the man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028611"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, a woman should have authority over her head, because of the angels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028612"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, in the Lord, the man is not independent of the woman, nor is the woman independent of the man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028613"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For just as woman was created from man, so also man is born through woman; but everything ultimately comes from God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028614"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Consider this carefully: Is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God without a head covering?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028615"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears his hair long, it is dishonorable to him?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028616"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if a woman has long hair, it is her glory, because her hair has been given to her as a covering.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028617"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if anyone appears to be argumentative or divisive, we do not follow such practices, nor do the churches of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028618"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this matter that I am addressing, I cannot commend you, for when you gather together, it does not lead to improvement but rather to harm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028619"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">First of all, when you gather together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and to some extent, I believe it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028620"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is necessary that there be divisions among you, so that those who are genuine may be clearly recognized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028621"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you gather together in one place, this is not to partake of the Lord's Supper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028622"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For when you come together to eat, each person goes ahead with their own meal, without waiting for others. As a result, one person goes hungry while another becomes overly full.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028623"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not have homes where you can eat and drink? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I commend you for this? No, I do not praise you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028624"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028625"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After giving thanks, he broke it and said, "Take and eat; this is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028626"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, after they had eaten, He took the cup and said, "This cup represents the new covenant established by My blood. Whenever you drink it, do so in remembrance of Me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028627"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he returns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028628"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, whoever eats this bread or drinks from the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028629"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Instead, each person should carefully reflect on their own heart and life, and then partake of the bread and drink from the cup in a manner that honors its sacred meaning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028630"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment upon themselves, failing to recognize the significance of the Lord's body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028631"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because of this, many among you are weak and ill, and a considerable number have died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028632"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If we were to examine and correct ourselves, we would not face judgment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028633"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When we face judgment, it is the Lord who disciplines us, so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028634"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, my brothers and sisters, when you gather together to eat, wait for one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028635"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that when you gather together, it will not lead to judgment. As for the remaining matters, I will address them when I come.</span></p>
