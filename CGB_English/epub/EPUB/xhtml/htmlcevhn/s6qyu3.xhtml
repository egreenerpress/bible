<h3 class="index-book-title">Genesis Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000320"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abram departed from Egypt, along with his wife, all his possessions, and Lot, his nephew, and they journeyed toward the southern region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000321"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abram was exceedingly wealthy, possessing large herds of livestock, as well as abundant silver and gold.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000322"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He continued his travels from the southern region all the way to Bethel, to the place where his tent had originally been set up, between Bethel and Ai.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000323"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To the location of the altar that he had originally built there, Abram went, and there he worshiped and proclaimed the name of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000324"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Lot, who traveled with Abram, also possessed flocks, herds, and tents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The land could not support them living together, because their possessions were so abundant that they were unable to remain in the same area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A conflict arose between the herdsmen who tended Abram’s livestock and those who tended Lot’s livestock. At that time, the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no conflict between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, because we are family."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Is not the entire land open before you? Please, separate yourself from me. If you choose to go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you prefer the right, I will go to the left.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Lot looked up and saw the entire plain of the Jordan, observing that it was abundantly watered everywhere—this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. The land was lush and fertile, like the garden of the LORD, resembling the richness of Egypt as one approaches Zoar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Lot chose for himself the entire plain of the Jordan, and he traveled eastward. In this way, they separated from one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot made his home in the cities of the plain and set up his tent near Sodom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the people of Sodom were deeply corrupt and committed great sins against the LORD, acting in ways that were exceedingly evil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are. Look to the north, the south, the east, and the west."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will give to you and your descendants forever all the land that you see before you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Get up and journey throughout the land, exploring its length and breadth, for I will give it to you as your possession."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Abram took down his tent and moved to the plain of Mamre, which is near Hebron, and settled there. He built an altar there to honor the LORD.</span></p>
