<h3 class="index-book-title">Hebrews Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030066"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030067"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To Abraham, Melchizedek also received a tenth of everything. First, his name means "King of Righteousness," and then he is also the King of Salem, which means "King of Peace."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030068"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This one has no father, no mother, no genealogy, no beginning of days, nor end of life, but is made like the Son of God, and remains a priest forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030069"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now reflect on how significant this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the spoils.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030070"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, those who belong to the tribe of Levi and are appointed to the priestly office have a command, based on the law, to collect tithes from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they too are descendants of Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030071"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the one who does not trace his lineage from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who possessed the promises.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030072"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Without any doubt, the lesser is blessed by the greater.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030073"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Here on earth, mortal men receive tithes, but in the case of the one spoken of, it is testified that he lives, and it is he who receives them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030074"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To put it another way, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030075"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he was still within his father’s lineage when Melchizedek encountered him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030076"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If, then, perfection could have been achieved through the Levitical priesthood—since it was under this priesthood that the people received the law—what further need would there have been for another priest to arise, belonging to the order of Melchizedek, rather than being designated according to the order of Aaron?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030077"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since the priesthood has been changed, it necessarily follows that there must also be a change in the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030078"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one about whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030079"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe about which Moses said nothing regarding the priesthood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030080"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And this becomes even more evident when we consider that another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030081"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was appointed not according to the law of a physical, external commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible and eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030082"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is declared, "You are a priest forever, in the manner of Melchizedek."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030083"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Certainly, the earlier commandment is set aside because it was weak and ineffective.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030084"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The law was unable to bring anything to perfection, but the introduction of a better hope has accomplished this; through this hope, we are able to draw near to God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030085"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And since he was made a priest not without an oath—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030086"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The former priests were established without an oath, but this one was appointed with an oath by God, who said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030087"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus has become the guarantee of a superior covenant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There were indeed many priests, because they were prevented from continuing in office due to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030089"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But this man, because he remains forever, holds a priesthood that is permanent and unchanging.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030090"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, he is fully capable of saving completely those who approach God through him, because he always lives to plead on their behalf.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030091"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We needed a high priest like this—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030092"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Unlike those high priests, who need to offer sacrifices daily—first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people—this one did not require such repeated offerings. He accomplished this once and for all when he offered up himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030093"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The law appoints as high priests those who are weak and subject to human limitations. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son, who has been perfected and set apart forever.</span></p>
