<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025938"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They started to accuse him, saying, "We found this man misleading the nation, telling people not to pay taxes to Caesar, and claiming that he himself is the Messiah, a king."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025939"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate questioned him, asking, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025940"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no guilt in this man."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025941"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They became even more aggressive, declaring, "He is inciting the people, spreading his teachings throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee and continuing to this very place."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025942"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Pilate heard the mention of Galilee, he inquired whether the man was from Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025943"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he learned that the man was under Herod’s authority, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025944"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Herod saw Jesus, he was extremely pleased, for he had wanted to see him for a long time. He had heard many reports about him and hoped to witness some miracle performed by him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025945"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he questioned him at length, but he gave him no reply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025946"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The high priests and religious scholars stood before him, making strong and forceful accusations against him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025947"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Herod, along with his soldiers, treated him with contempt and ridiculed him. They dressed him in a splendid robe and sent him back to Pilate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025948"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that same day, Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been hostile toward one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025949"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the leaders, and the people together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025950"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "You have brought this man to me, claiming that he misleads the people. But after examining him in your presence, I have found no basis for the charges you are making against him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025951"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No, not even Herod, for I sent you to him, and look, he has found nothing deserving of death in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025952"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will therefore have him punished and then release him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025953"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it was required that he release one prisoner to them during the festival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025954"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they all shouted together, saying, "Take this man away, and release Barabbas to us!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025955"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">(He was thrown into prison because he had caused a rebellion in the city and had committed murder.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025956"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate, therefore, wanting to set Jesus free, spoke to them again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025957"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they shouted, saying, "Put him to death on the cross! Put him to death on the cross!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025958"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them a third time, "Why? What wrong has he done? I have found no grounds for a death sentence in him. Therefore, I will have him punished and then release him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025959"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They pressed urgently with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. And the voices of the crowd, along with those of the chief priests, won out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025960"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then issued his judgment, granting what they had demanded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025961"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he released to them the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, the one they had asked for; but he handed over Jesus to their will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025962"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they took Jesus away, they seized a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene and was coming in from the countryside. They placed the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025963"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A large crowd of people followed him, including many women who were mourning and weeping for him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025964"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus turned to them and said, "Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; instead, weep for yourselves and for your children."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025965"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully, for the time is approaching when people will say, "Blessed are those who never had children, the women who never gave birth, and the breasts that never nursed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025966"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, people will cry out to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025967"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If such things are done when the circumstances are favorable, what will happen when they are unfavorable?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025968"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there were also two others, criminals, who were led with him to be executed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025969"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived at the place called Calvary, they crucified Him there, along with two criminals—one on His right and the other on His left.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025970"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not understand what they are doing." And they divided his clothing among themselves by casting lots.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025971"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd stood watching, and even the leaders joined in, mocking him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Messiah, God’s chosen one."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025972"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him and offering him sour wine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025973"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025975"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of the criminals who were being crucified alongside him hurled insults at him, saying, "If you are the Messiah, save yourself—and us as well!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025976"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the other criminal responded, rebuking him, saying, "Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same judgment?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025977"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are receiving what we deserve, for our actions have earned us this punishment. But this man has done nothing wrong.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025981"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The sun became darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in two, right down the middle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025982"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus cried out in a loud voice, he said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” And after saying this, he breathed his last.</span></p>
