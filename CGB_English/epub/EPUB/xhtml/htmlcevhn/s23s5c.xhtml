<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001264"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are all sons of one man; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001265"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "No, you have come to spy out the land's vulnerabilities."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001266"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied, "We are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001269"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Choose one of you to go and bring back your brother, while the rest of you remain confined in prison. This will test the truth of your words to see if you are being honest. Otherwise, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001270"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed them all in custody for three days.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001272"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in the place of your imprisonment. As for the rest of you, go and take grain to provide for the hunger in your households.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001273"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, bring your youngest brother to me; in this way, your words will be proven true, and you will not die." And they did as they were instructed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001274"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to one another, "We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we refused to listen. That is why this trouble has come upon us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001275"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Reuben responded to them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not harm the boy'?

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001277"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph turned away from them and wept. Then he turned back to them and spoke with them again. He took Simeon from among them and had him bound in their presence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001278"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s money into his sack, and to provide them with supplies for their journey. This is what he did for them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001279"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They loaded their donkeys with the grain and set out from there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001280"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey at the lodging place, he noticed his money—there it was, right at the top of his sack.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001281"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to his brothers, "My money has been returned—look, it’s right here in my sack!" Their hearts sank, and they were filled with fear, saying to one another, "What is this that God has done to us?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001282"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and recounted to him everything that had happened to them, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001283"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man, who is the ruler of the land, spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies sent to gather information about the country.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001284"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We said to him, "We are honest men; we are not spies."</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001286"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man, who was the ruler of the land, said to us, "This is how I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me, take provisions to relieve the hunger of your families, and then go on your way."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001287"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but honest men. In that case, I will release your brother to you, and you will be free to trade in the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001288"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were emptying their sacks, they discovered, to their astonishment, that each man’s pouch of money was still inside his sack.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001289"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have deprived me of my children: Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin away. Everything is working against me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001290"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Reuben said to his father, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you.
