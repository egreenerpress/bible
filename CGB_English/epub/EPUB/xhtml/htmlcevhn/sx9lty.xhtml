<h3 class="index-book-title">II Corinthians Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028879"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we know that if our earthly dwelling, this temporary tent, is taken down, we have a building from God—a house not made by human hands, eternal and permanent in the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028880"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For in this we deeply sigh, longing intensely to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028881"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If indeed, once we are clothed, we will not be found exposed or lacking.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028882"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we who dwell in this earthly tent groan under the weight of our burdens, not because we desire to be stripped of this body, but rather to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be fully overcome by life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028883"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who has prepared us for this very purpose is God, who has also given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, we are always full of confidence, knowing that as long as we are living in this physical body, we are away from the presence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we live and act according to what we believe, not by what we see with our eyes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are fully assured, I declare, and would much prefer to leave this earthly body behind and be in the presence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, we strive diligently, whether we are present in the body or absent from it, to be pleasing and acceptable to Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For all of us must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the actions done in the body, whether good or evil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028889"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Understanding, then, the fear of the Lord, we seek to convince others of the truth; and what we are is fully known to God, and I hope it is also evident to your conscience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but we are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you may have something to respond to those who boast about outward appearances rather than what is in the heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whether we are seen as being out of our minds, it is for God’s sake; or if we are in our right mind, it is for your benefit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that since one died for all, then all have died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised to life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, from now on, we no longer regard anyone from a worldly perspective. Even though we once viewed Christ in human terms, we no longer see Him in that way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, if anyone is united with Christ, they are a new creation: the old has passed away; look, everything has become new.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everything comes from God, who has restored our relationship with Himself through Jesus Christ and has entrusted us with the responsibility of proclaiming this reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028897"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This means that God, through Christ, was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting people’s sins against them. He has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are therefore representatives of Christ, as if God himself were appealing to you through us. We urge you, on behalf of Christ, to be reconciled to God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028899"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God made him, who knew no sin, to bear the weight of sin on our behalf, so that through him we might become the embodiment of God’s righteousness.</span></p>
