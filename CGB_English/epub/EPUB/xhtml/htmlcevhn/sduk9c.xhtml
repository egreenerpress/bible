<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023764"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and traveled to the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023765"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023766"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees also approached Him, testing Him, and asked, "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023767"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he responded to them, saying, "Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023768"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023769"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, they are no longer two separate individuals, but one united entity. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human should separate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023770"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked him, "Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023771"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the stubbornness of your hearts, but from the beginning, it was not meant to be this way."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you this: Anyone who divorces his wife, unless it is due to sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery. Likewise, whoever marries a woman who has been divorced also commits adultery.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a man and his wife, it would be better not to marry."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to them, "Not everyone is able to accept this teaching, except those to whom it has been granted."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023775"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For there are some who are eunuchs from birth, having been born that way from their mother’s womb. There are others who have been made eunuchs by human intervention. And there are those who have chosen to live as eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever is able to accept this, let them accept it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023776"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some people brought young children to him, asking that he lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded those who brought them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023777"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said, "Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023778"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed his hands on them and then left that place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023779"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, a man approached Him and said, "Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to gain eternal life?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023780"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is truly good except God alone. But if you desire to enter into eternal life, keep the commandments."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023781"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked Him, "Which ones?" Jesus replied, "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023782"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Respect and honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023783"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The young man said to him, "I have kept all these commandments since I was young. What am I still lacking?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023784"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be complete in your devotion, go and sell all that you possess, and give the proceeds to the poor. Then you will have lasting treasure in heaven. After that, come and follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023785"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the young man heard this, he went away deeply grieved, because he owned many possessions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023786"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I tell you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023787"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I say to you again: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023788"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When His disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and said, "Then who can possibly be saved?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023789"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus looked at them and said, "For people, this is impossible, but with God, everything is possible."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023790"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter responded to Him, saying, "Look, we have left everything behind and followed You. What will we receive in return?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023791"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, those of you who have followed me will, in the renewal of all things when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023792"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And anyone who has left behind houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of my name, will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023793"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, many who are now considered first in importance or status will end up being last, and those who are now regarded as last will become first.</span></p>
