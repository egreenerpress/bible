<h3 class="index-book-title">Ecclesiastes Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017383"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So I reflected and carefully considered all the acts of oppression that take place under the sun. I saw the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them. On the side of their oppressors, there was power, yet the oppressed had no one to bring them relief or solace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017384"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I consider those who have already died to be more fortunate than those who are still alive.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017385"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, better off is the one who has not yet been born, who has not witnessed the evil deeds that are carried out under the sun.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017386"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, I reflected on all the toil and every skillful endeavor that people undertake, and I saw that a person’s success often stirs envy in their neighbor. This too is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017387"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The foolish person sits idly with hands folded, bringing ruin upon themselves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017388"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is better to have a small portion with peace and contentment than to have both hands full with toil and the frustration that comes with it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017389"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I turned my attention again and observed the emptiness that exists under the sun.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017390"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One person stands alone, with no companion—no child, no brother. Yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with wealth. He never asks himself, 'For whom am I working so hard and depriving myself of enjoyment?' This too is meaningless—a grievous burden.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017391"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Two people are better than one, for they can achieve more through their combined efforts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017392"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If one person falls, the other can help them up. But it is a tragedy for someone who is alone when they fall, because there is no one to help them rise again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017393"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, if two people lie down together, they can keep each other warm; but how can someone stay warm alone?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017394"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If one person is overpowered, two can stand together against the attack; and a cord woven with three strands is not easily broken.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017395"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is better to have a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer listens to correction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017396"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A person may rise from prison to become a ruler, while another, born into royalty, may end up in poverty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017397"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I reflected on all the living who move about under the sun, along with the next generation that will rise up to take their place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017398"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There is no limit to the number of people who have lived before, and those who come after will not find joy in him. Truly, this too is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.</span></p>
