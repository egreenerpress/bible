<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024131"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When morning arrived, all the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered together to deliberate and plot against Jesus, intending to have him put to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had bound him, they took him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt deep remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they replied, "What does that have to do with us? That is your responsibility."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he threw the silver pieces down in the temple, left, and went away to hang himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The chief priests took the silver coins and said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the temple treasury, because it is blood money."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They deliberated and decided to use the money to purchase the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, the value placed on the one they valued."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they used it to buy the potter's field, just as the Lord had directed me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the chief priests and elders brought accusations against him, he remained silent and offered no response.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear all the accusations they are bringing against you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he did not respond to him with a single word, so much so that the governor was utterly astonished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that festival, it was the governor's custom to release to the people any prisoner they chose.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, "Who do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024148"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he understood that they had handed him over out of jealousy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024149"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he took his seat on the judgment bench, his wife sent him a message, saying, “Do not involve yourself with that innocent man, for today I have endured great distress in a dream because of him.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024150"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the chief priests and the elders convinced the crowd to demand Barabbas be released and to call for Jesus' execution.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024151"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The governor responded and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They replied, "Barabbas."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024152"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate said to them, "What then should I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?" They all replied, "Let him be crucified."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024153"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The governor asked, "What wrong has he done?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024154"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Pilate realized that he could not achieve anything and that instead a disturbance was growing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this righteous man’s blood. You are responsible for this."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024155"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then all the people responded, saying, "Let the responsibility for his blood be on us and on our descendants."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024156"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024157"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace courtyard and assembled the entire company of soldiers around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024158"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They removed his clothes and dressed him in a robe of scarlet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024159"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After weaving a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him in mockery, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024160"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They spat on him, took the reed, and struck him on the head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024161"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had finished mocking him, they removed the robe from him, put his own clothes back on, and led him away to be crucified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024162"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were leaving, they encountered a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross for Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024163"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived at a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull,"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024164"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They offered him wine mixed with bitter herbs to drink, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024165"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They nailed him to the cross and divided his clothing among themselves by casting lots. This happened to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: "They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024166"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They sat down and kept watch over him there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024167"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They placed above his head the written charge against him, which read: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024168"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, two criminals were crucified alongside him, one on his right side and the other on his left.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024169"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they walked by, they hurled insults at him, shaking their heads in scorn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024170"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They mocked him, saying, "You who claim to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are truly the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024171"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024172"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He has saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is truly the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and then we will believe in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024173"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed his trust in God; let God rescue him now, if He desires him, for he claimed, "I am the Son of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024174"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The criminals who were crucified alongside him also hurled insults at him, mocking him in the same way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024175"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered the entire land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024176"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Around three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024177"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of those who were standing nearby, upon hearing this, said, "This man is calling for Elijah."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, placed it on a stick, and offered it to him to drink.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The others said, "Leave him alone; let's see if Elijah comes to rescue him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, after crying out once more in a loud voice, gave up his spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And suddenly, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth shook, and the rocks split apart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had died were raised to life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And after His resurrection, they came out of the tombs, entered the holy city, and appeared to many people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, witnessed the earthquake and the events that took place, they were filled with great awe and said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many women were present, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving and supporting him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As evening approached, a wealthy man from Arimathea named Joseph arrived. He was also a disciple of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus. Pilate then ordered that the body be given to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were seated near the tomb, facing it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the day after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together and went to Pilate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">63 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Sir, we recall that this deceiver claimed while he was still alive, 'After three days, I will rise again.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">64 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, give the order to secure the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples do not come at night, steal his body, and then tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ If this happens, the final deception will be worse than the first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024195"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">65 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go and secure the tomb as best as you can."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024196"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">66 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting a guard.</span></p>
