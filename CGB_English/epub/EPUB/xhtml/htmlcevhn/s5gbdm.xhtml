<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Jesus traveled and ministered in Galilee, for He chose not to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders were seeking to kill Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So his brothers said to him, "Leave this place and go to Judea, so that your followers there may also see the works you are doing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For no one acts in secret while desiring to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, reveal yourself openly to the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even his own brothers did not believe in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "My appointed time has not yet arrived, but your time is always ready."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The world has no reason to hate you, but it hates me because I expose its actions as evil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Go up to this feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast yet, because the right time for me has not yet arrived."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had spoken these things to them, he remained in Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026339"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, he also went up, not publicly, but in a manner that was concealed, as if in secret.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026340"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the festival and asking, "Where is he?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026341"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a great deal of whispering and debate among the people about him. Some were saying, "He is a good man," while others argued, "No, he is misleading the people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026342"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, no one spoke openly about Him because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026343"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">About halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026344"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jews were amazed and said, "How does this man know so much about the Scriptures, since he has never been formally taught?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026345"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "What I teach is not my own, but comes from the one who sent me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026346"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone is willing to do God's will, they will come to understand whether this teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026347"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own honor, but the one who seeks the honor of the one who sent him is truthful, and there is no falsehood in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026348"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Did not Moses give you the Law, yet none of you keeps it? Why are you seeking to kill me?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026349"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people responded, "You are out of your mind! Who is trying to kill you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026350"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "I have performed one act, and you are all astonished."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026351"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moses gave you the practice of circumcision—though it did not originate with him but with the patriarchs—and you circumcise a man even on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026352"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a man undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not violated, why are you angry with me for making a man completely well on the Sabbath?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026353"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not make judgments based solely on outward appearances, but instead render decisions that are just and righteous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026354"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some of the people from Jerusalem said, "Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026355"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But look, he speaks openly and confidently, and they say nothing to stop him. Could it be that the rulers truly know this is indeed the Messiah?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026356"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, we know where this man comes from; but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026357"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus called out in the temple as he was teaching, saying, "You both know who I am, and you know where I come from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but the one who sent me is true—the one you do not know."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026358"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I know him, because I come from him, and he is the one who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026359"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that moment, they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his appointed time had not yet arrived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026360"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And many of the people came to believe in him, saying, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform greater signs than these that this man has done?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026361"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees heard that the people were whispering these things about him, so the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026362"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "I will be with you only a little longer, and then I will go to the one who sent me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026363"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will search for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026364"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jews said to one another, "Where does he intend to go that we will not be able to find him? Does he plan to go to the Jewish people scattered among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026365"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What kind of statement is this that He made: "You will seek Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come"?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026366"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the final day, the most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and called out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026367"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has declared, will have streams of living water flowing from within them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026368"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">(But he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026369"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, when many of the people heard these words, they said, "Truly, this man is the Prophet."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026370"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some people said, "This is the Messiah." But others questioned, "Can the Messiah really come from Galilee?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026371"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ comes from the lineage of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David lived?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026372"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As a result, the people were divided in their opinions about him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026373"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one actually laid a hand on him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026374"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn’t you bring him here?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026375"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The officers replied, "No one has ever spoken the way this man speaks."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026376"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees responded to them, "Have you also been led astray?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026377"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Have any of the leaders or the Pharisees put their faith in him?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026378"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But these people, who do not understand the law, are under a curse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026379"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus at night and was one of their own, said to them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026380"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing their case and understanding what they have done?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026381"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Look into it and see for yourself: no prophet has ever come from Galilee."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026382"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And each person returned to their own home.</span></p>
