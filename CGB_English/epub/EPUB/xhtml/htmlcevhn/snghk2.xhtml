Then I will bring a curse upon myself instead of a blessing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000741"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His mother said to him, "Let the curse fall on me, my son.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000746"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He approached his father and said, "Father?"

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000749"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac said to Jacob, "Come closer, please, so that I can touch you, my son, and know whether you are truly my son Esau or not."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000750"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob approached his father Isaac, and Isaac touched him.

And so he blessed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000752"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he asked, "Are you truly my son Esau?" And he replied, "I am."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000753"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Bring it here to me, so that I may eat some of my son’s game and then bless you." So he brought it to him, and he ate. Then he brought him wine, and he drank.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000754"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come close now, and kiss me, my son."</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000756"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, may God grant you the dew from heaven, the richness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000759"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father.

For he has deceived me twice: he took away my birthright, and now, look, he has taken away my blessing as well." Then he asked, "Have you not kept any blessing for me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000765"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac responded to Esau, saying, "Listen, I have made him your master, and I have given all his brothers to him as servants. I have provided for him with grain and wine. So now, what can I possibly do for you, my son?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000766"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father?

But when you grow restless and gain control, you will throw off his yoke from your neck.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000769"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Esau harbored deep resentment toward Jacob because of the blessing their father had given him. In his heart, Esau thought, "The time of mourning for my father is near; once he is gone, I will kill my brother Jacob."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000770"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Rebekah was informed of the words spoken by her older son, Esau.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stay with him for a short while, until your brother's anger subsides.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Wait until your brother's anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you have done to him.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am utterly weary of my life because of the Hittite women.
