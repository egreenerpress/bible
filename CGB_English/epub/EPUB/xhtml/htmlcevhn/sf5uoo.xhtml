<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025365"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them out in pairs ahead of him to every town and place where he himself intended to go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025366"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025367"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Go on your way: listen carefully, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025368"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not take a money bag, a traveling bag, or extra sandals, and do not greet anyone along the way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025369"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you enter any house, first say, "May peace be upon this household."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025370"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a person of peace is present there, your peace will remain with them; but if not, your peace will return to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025371"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stay in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move from house to house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025372"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you enter any city and the people welcome you, eat whatever food is provided for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025373"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Go and heal those who are sick in that place, and tell them, "The kingdom of God has come near to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025374"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when you enter any city and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and declare,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025375"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet understand this clearly: the kingdom of God has come near to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025376"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you this: on that day, it will be more bearable for Sodom than for that city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025377"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles performed among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, showing their sorrow by wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025378"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025379"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you, Capernaum, who have been lifted up to the heights, will be brought down to the depths of destruction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025380"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever listens to you listens to me; and whoever rejects you rejects me; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025381"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The seventy returned with great joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025382"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025383"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully: I am granting you authority to walk upon serpents and scorpions, and to overcome all the strength of the adversary. Nothing will be able to harm you in any way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025384"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, do not rejoice because the spirits submit to you; instead, rejoice because your names are recorded in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025385"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that moment, Jesus was filled with joy by the Holy Spirit and said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025386"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father. No one truly knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one truly knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025387"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them in private, "How fortunate are the eyes that see what you are seeing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025388"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I assure you, many prophets and kings longed to witness what you now see, yet they did not see it; and to hear what you now hear, yet they did not hear it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025389"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And then, a certain expert in the law stood up and tested Him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025390"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked him, "What is written in the law? How do you understand it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025391"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your neighbor as yourself."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025392"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025393"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he, seeking to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025394"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded by saying, "There was a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho who was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him severely, and went away, leaving him nearly dead."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025395"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it happened, a certain priest was traveling down that same road. When he saw the man, he crossed to the other side and passed by.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025396"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, a Levite, when he arrived at that place, came and saw the man but crossed to the other side of the road and passed by.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025397"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But as a certain Samaritan was traveling, he came to the place where the man was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025398"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He approached the injured man, tended to his wounds by applying oil and wine, and carefully bandaged them. Then he placed the man on his own animal, transported him to an inn, and provided for his care.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025399"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, as he was leaving, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, "Look after him, and whatever additional expenses you incur, I will repay you when I return."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025400"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which of these three, in your opinion, acted as a true neighbor to the man who was attacked by the robbers?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025401"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "The one who showed him compassion." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025402"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they traveled, Jesus came to a particular village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025403"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus, listening to his teaching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025404"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Martha was overwhelmed with all the tasks of serving, and she came to him and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to come and help me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025405"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus responded, saying to her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and overwhelmed by many concerns."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025406"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, only one thing is truly necessary: Mary has chosen the better portion, and it will not be taken away from her.</span></p>
