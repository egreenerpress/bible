<h3 class="index-book-title">Hebrews Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030032"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Every high priest chosen from among people is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, so that he may present both offerings and sacrifices for sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030033"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who is able to show understanding and mercy toward those who are unaware or misguided, since he himself is also surrounded by weakness?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030034"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because of this, he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people but also for himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030035"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one takes this honor upon themselves, but only those who are called by God, just as Aaron was.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030036"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest; rather, it was God who declared to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030037"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is also stated elsewhere, "You are a priest forever, in the manner of Melchizedek."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030038"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">During the time when he lived in human form, he offered up earnest prayers and heartfelt pleas, with loud cries and tears, to the one who had the power to save him from death. And because of his deep reverence, his prayer was heard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030039"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Although he was the Son, he learned obedience through what he endured.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030040"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And when he was fully perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who submit to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030041"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Appointed by God as a high priest, following the pattern of Melchizedek.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030042"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There are many things we could say about this subject, but they are difficult to explain because you have become slow to understand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030043"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For by this time, you ought to be teachers, yet you still need someone to teach you the basic principles of Godâ€™s word all over again. You have become like those who need milk instead of solid food.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030044"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For anyone who relies only on milk is inexperienced in understanding the message of righteousness; they are like an infant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030045"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, solid food is for those who are mature, for those who, through constant practice, have trained their faculties to distinguish between what is good and what is evil.</span></p>
