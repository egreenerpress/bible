<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005528"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if she leaves his house, she is free to go and become the wife of another man.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100005533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If someone is found kidnapping any of their fellow Israelites and treating them as property, or selling them, then that thief must be put to death.
