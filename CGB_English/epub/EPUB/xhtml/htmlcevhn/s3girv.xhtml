<h3 class="index-book-title">Isaiah Chapter 52</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018698"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with strength, O Zion; put on your splendid garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For from now on, the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer enter you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018699"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Rise up from the dust; stand up and take your place, O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018700"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is what the LORD says: You have given yourselves up for nothing, and you will be set free without any payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018701"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is what the Lord GOD says: Long ago, my people went down to Egypt to live there as foreigners, but the Assyrians oppressed them without any just cause.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018702"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So now, what do I have here, declares the LORD, when my people are taken away without cause? Their rulers make them wail in anguish, says the LORD, and my name is constantly blasphemed every single day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018703"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, my people will come to know my name; they will understand on that day that I am the one who declares these things. Behold, it is I who speaks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018704"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How lovely on the mountains are the feet of the one who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who announces good things, who declares salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018705"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your watchmen will raise their voices; together they will sing aloud, for they will see clearly with their own eyes when the LORD restores Zion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018706"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Shout for joy and sing aloud, you desolate places of Jerusalem! For the LORD has brought comfort to His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018707"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD has revealed His holy power before the eyes of all the nations, and all the farthest reaches of the earth will witness the salvation brought by our God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018708"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Leave at once, leave at once! Get out from there and do not touch anything unclean. Come out from among them and purify yourselves, you who carry the sacred vessels of the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018709"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will not leave in a hurried rush, nor will you flee in panic, for the LORD will march ahead of you, and the God of Israel will guard your rear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018710"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Behold, my servant will act wisely; he will be lifted up, honored, and raised to great heights. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018711"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many were astonished at himâ€”his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being, and his form beyond that of mortals.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018712"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this way, he will purify many nations; kings will be silenced in his presence. For they will witness what they had never been told, and they will understand what they had never heard before.</span></p>
