<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021660"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The burnt offering that the leader shall present to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall consist of six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram.</span></p>

No one is to go back the way they entered; instead, they must leave by the opposite gate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021666"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The leader among them, when they enter, shall enter with them; and when they depart, he shall depart with them.</span></p>

He shall prepare his burnt offering and peace offerings just as he does on the Sabbath day. After he has presented his offerings, he shall leave, and the gate shall be closed once he has gone out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021669"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You shall offer a daily burnt sacrifice to the LORD, consisting of a year-old lamb without any defect. You are to prepare this offering every morning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021670"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You shall prepare a grain offering for it every morning, consisting of one-sixth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021673"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if the prince gives a portion of his inheritance as a gift to one of his servants, it shall belong to that servant until the Year of Jubilee. After that, it must return to the prince. But the princeâ€™s inheritance shall remain with his sons; it is their permanent possession.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021674"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, the ruler must not seize the people's inheritance through oppression, forcing them out of their property. Instead, he must provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possessions, so that my people are not driven away, each person losing their rightful property.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021675"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he led me through the entrance, which was on the side of the gate, into the sacred chambers of the priests that faced north, I saw a space on the western side, extending along both sides.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021676"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to me, "This is the place where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will prepare the grain offering, so that they do not have to carry them out into the outer courtyard and risk making the people holy unintentionally."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021677"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he led me out to the outer courtyard and guided me around its four corners. In each corner of the courtyard, there was another smaller courtyard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021678"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In each of the four corners of the courtyard, there were smaller enclosed areas, each measuring forty cubits in length and thirty cubits in width. These four corner areas were all of the same size.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021679"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a row of chambers surrounding the building, encompassing all four sides. Beneath these rows of chambers, there were boiling areas constructed all around.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100021680"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to me, "These are the cooking areas where the servants of the temple will prepare the sacrifices offered by the people."</span></p>
