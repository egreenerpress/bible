<h3 class="index-book-title">Acts Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027771"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Five days later, Ananias the high priest came down with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They presented their case against Paul to the governor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he was brought forward, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Because of you, we enjoy great peace, and through your foresight, many beneficial reforms have been brought to this nation."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We continually and everywhere acknowledge this, most honorable Felix, with the utmost gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, so as not to burden you further, I kindly ask that you would graciously hear us for just a few words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027775"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We have found this man to be a dangerous troublemaker, stirring up rebellion among all the Jews across the world. He is a leading figure in the sect known as the Nazarenes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027776"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This man has also attempted to defile the temple, and we seized him, intending to judge him according to our own law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027777"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the commander Lysias intervened, and with overwhelming force, he seized him from our custody.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027778"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He instructed his accusers to come before you, so that by questioning them yourself, you may determine the truth of all these charges we are bringing against him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027779"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders also agreed, affirming that these statements were true.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027780"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, when the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied, "Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am all the more willing to make my defense."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027781"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that you may understand, it has only been twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027782"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not find me arguing with anyone in the temple, nor stirring up a crowd, nor causing trouble in the synagogues or anywhere in the city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027783"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They cannot provide evidence for the charges they are now bringing against me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027784"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I openly admit this to you: I follow the way that some call a sect, but I worship the God of our ancestors, holding firmly to everything written in the Law and the Prophets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027785"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have hope in God, a hope which they themselves also hold, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027786"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this matter, I strive diligently to maintain a clear conscience before God and before people at all times.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027787"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After many years had passed, I returned to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027788"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some Jews from Asia found me in the temple, having completed the purification rites, without any crowd or disturbance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027789"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people who should have been present here before you are the ones who could bring charges against me, if they had any accusations to make.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027790"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Alternatively, let these men here declare if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027791"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Unless it is for this one statement I made while standing among them: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged by you today.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027792"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Felix heard these things, being well acquainted with the beliefs and practices of this movement, he postponed their case and said, "When Commander Lysias arrives, I will thoroughly examine your matter and make a decision."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027793"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He ordered a centurion to guard Paul but to allow him some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from assisting him or visiting him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027794"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After some time had passed, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027795"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Paul spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became deeply unsettled and replied, "Leave for now. When I find a more suitable time, I will send for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027796"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also hoped that Paul would offer him money to secure his release. For this reason, he frequently sent for Paul and conversed with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027797"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After two years, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix as governor. Felix, wanting to gain favor with the Jewish leaders, left Paul imprisoned.</span></p>
