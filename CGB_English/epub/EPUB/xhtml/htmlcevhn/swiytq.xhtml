<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026097"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana, a town in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was present there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026098"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding celebration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026099"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026100"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Dear woman, why do you involve me in this? My appointed time has not yet arrived."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026101"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he tells you to do, do it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026102"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There were six stone water jars placed there, used by the Jews for ceremonial purification, each holding between twenty and thirty gallons.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026103"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them to the very top.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026104"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Take some now and bring it to the master of the banquet." So they brought it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine, he did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew). So the master of the banquet called the bridegroom aside.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to him, "Everyone serves the best wine first, and after people have had plenty to drink, they bring out the cheaper wine. But you have saved the best until now."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026107"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This was the first of the miraculous signs that Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. Through it, he revealed his divine glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After this, he went down to Capernaum—he, along with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples. They stayed there for only a few days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish Passover was approaching, and Jesus traveled to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the temple, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as money changers seated at their tables.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, after making a whip from cords, he drove everyone out of the temple, along with the sheep and oxen. He scattered the money of the money changers and overturned their tables.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to those who were selling doves, "Take these things away from here. Do not turn my Father's house into a marketplace."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And his disciples recalled what was written: "Passion for your house will consume me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jewish leaders responded and said to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority, since you are doing these things?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Tear down this temple, and in three days I will rebuild it."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jewish leaders said, "This temple took forty-six years to build, and you claim you can raise it up in three days?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, he was referring to the temple of his own body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus rose from the dead, his disciples recalled that he had spoken these words to them. They then believed both the Scripture and the message Jesus had delivered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover festival, many people came to believe in him because they witnessed the miraculous signs he performed. Their faith was inspired by what they saw him do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people intimately.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He did not need anyone to testify about humanity, for He understood what was within a person.</span></p>
