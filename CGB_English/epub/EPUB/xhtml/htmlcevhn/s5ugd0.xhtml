His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023492"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023493"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023494"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How he went into the house of God and ate the sacred bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023495"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple perform duties that would otherwise desecrate the Sabbath, yet they are considered guiltless?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023496"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you, someone greater than the temple is here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023497"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if you had understood the meaning of this: 'I desire compassion, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned those who are innocent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023498"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Son of Man has authority even over the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023499"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After leaving that place, he entered their synagogue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023500"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And look, there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?”—this they asked so they might have grounds to accuse him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023501"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "If any of you has a single sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, won’t you take hold of it and pull it out?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023502"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How much more valuable is a person than a sheep? Therefore, it is right to do good on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023503"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." The man stretched it out, and it was completely restored, as healthy as the other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023504"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Pharisees left and convened a meeting to plot how they might put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023505"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus became aware of this, he withdrew from that place. Large crowds followed him, and he healed all of them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023506"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he instructed them not to reveal who he was.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023507"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This happened to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023508"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom I delight. I will place my Spirit upon him, and he will bring justice to the nations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023509"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will not argue or shout, nor will anyone hear his voice raised in public.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023510"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will not crush a weakened reed, nor will he extinguish a smoldering wick, until he brings justice to its full triumph.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023511"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And in his name, the nations will place their hope.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023512"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they brought to him a man who was demon-possessed, blind, and unable to speak. Jesus healed him, so that the man who had been blind and mute could both speak and see.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023513"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the people were astonished and said, "Isn't this the son of David?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023514"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Pharisees heard about this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023515"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, aware of their thoughts, said to them, "Any kingdom that is divided against itself will be ruined, and any city or household that is divided against itself cannot endure."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023516"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then can his kingdom endure?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023517"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul, by whose power do your own followers cast them out? Therefore, they will be the ones to judge you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023518"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if I drive out demons by the power of God’s Spirit, then the kingdom of God has indeed come upon you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023519"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Otherwise, how can someone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Only then can he plunder his house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023520"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever does not stand with me is opposed to me, and whoever does not gather with me causes division and scattering.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023521"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I tell you this: every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023522"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023523"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Either make the tree healthy, so that its fruit is good, or make the tree diseased, so that its fruit is bad; for a tree is recognized by its fruit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023524"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You brood of vipers! How can you, who are evil, say anything good? For what comes out of the mouth flows from the abundance of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023525"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A good person, from the good stored up in their heart, produces good things; and an evil person, from the evil stored up within them, produces evil things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023526"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you this: people will have to give an account for every careless word they speak on the day of judgment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023527"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For through your words you will be declared righteous, and through your words you will be judged guilty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023528"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees responded, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023529"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus responded to them, saying, "A wicked and unfaithful generation demands a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023530"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so too will the Son of Man spend three days and three nights in the depths of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023531"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment alongside this generation and will condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them. And now, someone greater than Jonah is here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023532"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment alongside this generation and condemn it, for she traveled from the farthest reaches of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon. Yet now, someone greater than Solomon is here.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it travels through arid places, searching for rest, but finds none.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023534"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I left.' And when he arrives, he finds it empty, cleaned, and put in order.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023535"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and settle there. As a result, the final condition of that person becomes worse than the first. This is how it will also be for this wicked generation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023536"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, wanting to speak with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023537"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then someone said to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023538"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he responded to the one who told him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023539"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he extended his hand toward his disciples and said, "Look, here are my mother and my brothers!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023540"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For anyone who carries out the will of my Father in heaven, that person is my brother, my sister, and my mother.</span></p>
