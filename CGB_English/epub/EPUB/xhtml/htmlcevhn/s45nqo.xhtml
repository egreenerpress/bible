<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026787"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had finished speaking these words, he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden. He entered it, along with his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026788"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often went there with his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026789"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judas, having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, arrived there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026790"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus, fully aware of everything that was about to happen to him, stepped forward and asked them, “Who are you looking for?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026791"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am he." And Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026792"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as He said to them, "I am He," they drew back and fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026793"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he asked them, "Who are you looking for?" They replied, "Jesus of Nazareth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026794"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "I have already told you that I am the one you are looking for. So if it is me you seek, let these others go free."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026795"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This happened so that the statement he made might be fulfilled: "I have not lost any of those you gave me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026796"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026797"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. The cup that my Father has given me—should I not drink it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026798"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the detachment of soldiers, along with the commander and the Jewish officials, seized Jesus and bound him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026799"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They took him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026800"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was better for one man to die on behalf of the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026801"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter followed Jesus, along with another disciple. This disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest’s residence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026802"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter remained standing outside the door. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who was keeping the door, and he brought Peter inside.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026803"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the servant girl who was in charge of the door said to Peter, "Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?" He replied, "I am not."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026804"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The servants and guards were standing there, having made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also stood among them, warming himself by the fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026805"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teachings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026806"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied to him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews gather. I have said nothing in secret."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026807"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why are you questioning me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. Look, they know what I spoke.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026808"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus had finished speaking, one of the officers standing nearby struck him with his hand and said, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026809"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify about what was wrong. But if I spoke rightly, why do you strike me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026810"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Annas had sent him, bound, to Caiaphas, the high priest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026811"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter stood there, warming himself. Then they asked him, "Aren’t you also one of his disciples?" But he denied it, saying, "I am not."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026812"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026813"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter denied it once more, and at that very moment, the rooster crowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026814"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters. It was early in the morning, and they themselves did not enter the headquarters, to avoid becoming ceremonially unclean, so that they could still eat the Passover meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026815"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then went out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026816"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026817"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him according to your own law." But the Jewish leaders replied, "We are not permitted to execute anyone."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026818"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken might be fulfilled, indicating the kind of death he was to die.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026819"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then went back into the governor’s headquarters and summoned Jesus. He asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026820"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to him, "Are you saying this on your own, or did others tell you about me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026821"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate responded, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026822"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "My kingdom does not originate from this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly fight to prevent me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026823"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then said to him, “So, are you a king?” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this reason I came into the world: to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026824"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” After saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no basis for any charge against him.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026825"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have a tradition that I should release one prisoner to you during the Passover. So, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026826"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a notorious criminal.</span></p>
