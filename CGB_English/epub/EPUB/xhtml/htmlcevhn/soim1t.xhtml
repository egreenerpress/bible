<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026582"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived—the man who had died but whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026583"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They prepared a meal for him there, and Martha served the food. Lazarus, who had been raised from the dead, was among those sitting at the table with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026584"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Mary then took a pound of very expensive perfume made from pure spikenard, anointed Jesus’ feet with it, and wiped his feet with her hair. The fragrance of the perfume filled the entire house.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026585"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who would later betray him, said:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026586"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026587"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the money bag and used to steal from what was put into it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026588"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026589"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026590"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026591"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The chief priests then plotted to have Lazarus killed as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026592"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because of him, many of the Jewish people departed from their previous beliefs and came to trust in Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026593"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the following day, a large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was entering Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026594"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026595"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat upon it, just as it is written:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026596"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your King is coming, seated on a young donkey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026597"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At first, his disciples did not understand these things. However, after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these events had been written about him and that they had carried out these actions toward him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026598"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead testified to what they had seen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026599"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because of this, the crowd also went out to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this miraculous sign.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026600"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees then said to one another, "Do you see how you are accomplishing nothing? Look, the whole world is following him!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026601"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Among those present were some Greeks who had come to worship at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026602"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So this man approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip went and informed Andrew, and then both Andrew and Philip went to tell Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus responded to them, saying, "The time has now come for the Son of Man to be honored and exalted."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026605"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026606"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever clings to their life in this world will ultimately lose it, but whoever is willing to let go of their life in this world for my sake will preserve it for eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026607"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone serves me, let them follow me; and wherever I am, my servant will also be there. If anyone serves me, my Father will honor them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026608"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"My heart is deeply troubled now. What should I say? Father, save me from this moment of suffering? Yet, it is precisely for this purpose that I have come to this hour."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026609"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Father, bring honor to your name. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have already brought it honor, and I will bring it honor again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026610"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd standing nearby, who heard the sound, said it was thunder. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026611"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded, saying, "This voice did not come for my sake, but for yours."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026612"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now is the time for the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026613"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I, when I am raised up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026614"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said this to indicate the kind of death he was going to experience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026615"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people responded to him, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah remains forever. So how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man you are speaking of?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026616"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "The light will remain with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. For whoever walks in darkness does not know where they are going."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026617"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While you have the light, trust in the light, so that you may become children of light."

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026619"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This happened so that the words spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed what we have proclaimed? And to whom has the power of the Lord been made known?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026620"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, they were unable to believe, because Isaiah also said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026621"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He has caused their eyes to be blind and their hearts to be hardened, so that they cannot see with their eyes or comprehend with their hearts, and thus turn back to me, that I might heal them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026622"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke about Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026623"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even among the prominent leaders, many believed in him; yet because of the Pharisees, they did not openly acknowledge their faith, fearing they would be expelled from the synagogue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026624"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For they valued the approval of people more than the approval of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026625"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus exclaimed, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me alone, but in the one who sent me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026626"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026628"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not condemn them, for I did not come to condemn the world, but to save it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026629"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever rejects me and does not accept my words already has a judge: the very message I have spoken will condemn them on the final day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026630"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me has given me a command regarding what I should say and what I should speak.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026631"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I know that his command leads to eternal life. Therefore, whatever I say is exactly as the Father has instructed me to speak.</span></p>
