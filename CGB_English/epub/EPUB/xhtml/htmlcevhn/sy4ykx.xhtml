<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will speak using parables; I will share profound and ancient mysteries. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We have heard and come to understand these things, just as our ancestors have recounted them to us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We will not conceal these truths from our children, but will declare to the coming generation the praises of the LORD, His mighty power, and the wondrous deeds He has accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For He established a covenant witness in Jacob and set a decree in Israel, which He commanded our ancestors to teach to their children, so that the next generation might know them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is so that the next generation might know them, even the children yet to be born, who will rise up and recount them to their own children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015121"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that they might place their trust in God, and not overlook the mighty deeds He has done, but faithfully obey His commands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And so they would not be like their ancestorsâ€”a stubborn and defiant generation, a generation whose hearts were not loyal to God, and whose spirits were not faithful to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The descendants of Ephraim, though equipped with weapons and armed with bows, retreated and turned away on the day of battle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not uphold God's covenant and chose not to follow His law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they forgot His deeds, and the miraculous wonders He had shown them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He performed extraordinary wonders in the presence of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also made water flow from the rock, bringing forth streams, and caused waters to pour down like rivers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they tested God in their hearts by demanding food to satisfy their cravings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, they spoke against God, saying, "Can God prepare a feast in the wilderness?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Look, he struck the rock, and water poured out, and streams overflowed abundantly. But can he also provide bread? Can he supply meat for his people?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, the LORD heard this and was filled with wrath; so a fire was ignited against Jacob, and His anger rose against Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Because they did not have faith in God, nor did they rely on His deliverance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Though He had given orders to the clouds above and opened the gates of the heavens,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He provided them with manna to eat, raining it down from above, and gave them grain from heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people ate the food of heaven; God provided them with abundant nourishment to satisfy their hunger.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He made an east wind blow across the sky, and by His might, He brought forth a south wind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent down meat for them like a cloud of dust, and winged birds as plentiful as the sand by the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He caused it to fall in the center of their camp, surrounding their dwellings on all sides.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they ate and were fully satisfied, for he granted them what they longed for.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not turn away from their desires. Even while the food was still in their mouths,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God's anger rose against them, and He struck down the strongest among them, cutting down the finest warriors of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Despite all this, they continued to sin and did not trust in His marvelous works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As a result, He caused their days to be spent in futility and their years to be filled with distress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015148"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When He caused their death, they sought Him; they turned back and earnestly sought God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015149"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they recalled that God was their steadfast foundation, and the Most High God their deliverer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015150"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet they spoke to him with flattering words and deceived him with their tongues.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015151"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For their hearts were not truly devoted to him, nor were they faithful in upholding his covenant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015152"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet, overflowing with compassion, he forgave their wrongdoing and did not destroy them. Time and again, he held back his anger and did not unleash the full force of his wrath.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015153"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For He remembered that they were merely mortalâ€”a fleeting breath that passes away and does not return.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015154"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness and caused Him sorrow in the desert!</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015162"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He also surrendered their livestock to the destructive hail and their flocks to the scorching bolts of lightning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015163"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He unleashed upon them the full intensity of his anger, fury, and righteous indignation, bringing distress and calamity by dispatching destructive messengers among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015164"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He paved a path for His wrath; He did not spare their lives from death, but handed them over to the plague.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015165"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the most vital of their strength in the dwellings of Ham.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015166"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But He led His own people out like a flock of sheep, guiding them through the wilderness as a shepherd guides his flock.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015167"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He guided them securely, so that they had no fear; yet the sea engulfed their enemies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015168"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He led them to the boundary of His holy place, to this mountain, which His mighty hand had secured.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015169"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He drove out the nations before them and allotted their land as an inheritance, apportioning it by boundary lines.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015171"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, they turned away and acted treacherously, just as their ancestors had done; they were like a faulty bow that fails to shoot straight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100015172"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They angered Him by building worship sites on high places and aroused His jealousy by crafting carved idols.</span></p>
