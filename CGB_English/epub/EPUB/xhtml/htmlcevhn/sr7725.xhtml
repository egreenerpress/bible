<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025152"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "The Son of Man is also Lord over the Sabbath."</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025156"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "Let me ask you something: Is it permitted to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to destroy it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025157"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus looked around at all of them and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
