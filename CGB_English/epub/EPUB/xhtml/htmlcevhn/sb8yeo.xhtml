<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000305"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abram journeyed through the land as far as the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000312"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Please say that you are my sister, so that things may go well for me because of you, and my life may be spared on your account.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000313"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians noticed that his wife was exceptionally beautiful.</span></p>
