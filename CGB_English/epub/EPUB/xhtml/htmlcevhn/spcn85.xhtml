<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009319"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Elijah the Tishbite, who was from the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, "As surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives—the God before whom I stand—there will be neither dew nor rain during these coming years, except at my command."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009320"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD spoke to him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009321"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Go from here and turn eastward, and conceal yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009322"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will drink from the stream, and I have directed the ravens to provide food for you there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009323"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he went and acted in accordance with the word of the LORD. He went and settled by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009324"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank water from the stream.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After some time had passed, the stream dried up because there had been no rain in the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD spoke to him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Get up and go to Zarephath, a town in the region of Sidon, and stay there. I have directed a widow in that place to provide for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, he saw a widow there gathering sticks. He called out to her and said, “Please, bring me a little water in a container so I can drink.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As she was going to get it, he called out to her and said, "Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She replied, "As surely as the LORD your God lives, I have no bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks so I can go in and prepare it for myself and my son. We will eat it and then die."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid. Go and do as you have said, but first prepare a small loaf of bread for me and bring it to me. Afterward, you may make some for yourself and your son."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: The jar of flour will not run out, and the jug of oil will not run dry, until the day the LORD sends rain upon the earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She went and acted according to Elijah's instruction.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She said to Elijah, "What do I have to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to remind me of my sin and to cause the death of my son?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to her, "Give me your son." Then he took the child from her arms, carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he called out to the LORD and said, "O LORD my God, have you also brought calamity upon the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009339"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to the LORD, saying, "O LORD my God, I ask you, please let this child’s life return to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009340"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD listened to Elijah’s plea, and the child’s life returned to him, and he was restored to life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009341"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Elijah took the child and carried him down from the upper room into the house. He handed the boy to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100009342"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman said to Elijah, "Now I know for certain that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD spoken through you is true."</span></p>
