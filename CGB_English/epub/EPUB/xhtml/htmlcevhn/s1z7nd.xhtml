We will burn your house down with you in it!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100006872"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jephthah replied to them, "My people and I were engaged in a fierce conflict with the Ammonites.

So why have you now come up against me today to fight me?</span></p>
