<h3 class="index-book-title">Revelation Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030863"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud. A rainbow encircled his head, his face shone like the sun, and his feet were like fiery pillars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030864"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In his hand, he held a small scroll that was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030865"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he called out with a mighty voice, like the roar of a lion, and when he had cried out, the seven thunders spoke with their own voices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030866"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write down what they said. But then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Keep secret the words spoken by the seven thunders, and do not write them down."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030867"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his hand toward heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030868"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he swore by the one who lives forever and ever, the one who created heaven and all that is in it, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, declaring that there would be no more delay.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030869"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the hidden plan of God will be brought to completion, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030870"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the voice I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go and take the small scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030871"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I approached the angel and said to him, "Give me the small scroll." He replied, "Take it and consume it. It will turn bitter in your stomach, but in your mouth, it will be as sweet as honey."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030872"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I took the small scroll from the angelâ€™s hand and ate it. In my mouth, it was as sweet as honey, but after I had swallowed it, my stomach turned bitter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030873"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to me, "You must prophesy once more to many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."</span></p>
