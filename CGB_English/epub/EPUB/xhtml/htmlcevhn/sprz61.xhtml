<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025866"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Festival of Unleavened Bread, known as Passover, was approaching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025867"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The leading priests and religious teachers were looking for a way to have him killed, because they were afraid of the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025868"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025869"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left and consulted with the chief priests and the officers, discussing how he might betray Jesus to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025870"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were pleased and made an agreement to pay him money.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025871"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray him to them when the crowd was not present.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025872"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025873"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make the necessary preparations for us to eat the Passover meal."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025874"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked him, "Where do you want us to make the preparations?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025875"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Listen carefully: when you enter the city, a man carrying a water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025876"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you shall say to the owner of the house, "The Teacher asks you, 'Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025877"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare everything there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025878"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025879"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the time had arrived, he took his place at the table, and the twelve apostles joined him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025880"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I endure suffering."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025881"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025882"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025883"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, then gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, after the meal, He took the cup and said, "This cup represents the new covenant established by My blood, which is poured out for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But look, the hand of the one who will betray me is here with me on the table.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been divinely ordained. But how terrible it will be for that man who betrays Him!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they began to discuss among themselves, questioning which one of them would be the one to do this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025889"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there was also a dispute among them about which of them should be considered the greatest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "The rulers of the nations dominate over them, and those who hold power over them are called 'benefactors.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, this should not be the case among you. Instead, the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the one who leads must become like one who serves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which one is greater: the person who sits at the table to eat, or the one who serves? Isn’t it the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are the ones who have stood by me through my trials and challenges.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I grant you a kingdom, just as my Father has granted one to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, listen carefully: Satan has asked to have all of you, so that he might sift you like wheat."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025897"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I have prayed for you, that your faith may not falter. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "Lord, I am prepared to follow you, even to prison and to death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025899"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today before you deny three times that you know Me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025900"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "When I sent you out without a money bag, a traveler’s bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?" They replied, "Nothing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025901"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "But now, whoever has a money bag should take it, and also a traveling bag. And whoever does not have a sword should sell their cloak and buy one."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025902"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I tell you, what is written must still be fulfilled in me: "He was counted among the lawless." For all that is written about me is reaching its completion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025903"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." He replied to them, "That is sufficient."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025904"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025905"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you do not fall into temptation."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025906"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He moved away from them, about the distance of a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025907"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Father, if you are willing, take this suffering away from me. Yet, not my will, but yours, be done."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025908"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, giving him strength.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025909"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In deep anguish, he prayed with even greater intensity, and his sweat became like heavy drops of blood falling to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025910"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Jesus finished praying and returned to his disciples, he found them asleep, overcome by grief.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025911"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025912"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was still speaking, suddenly a crowd appeared, and Judas, one of the twelve disciples, led them. He approached Jesus to kiss him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025913"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025914"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When those who were with him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025915"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of them struck the high priest’s servant and severed his right ear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025916"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus responded, saying, "Let this be enough for now." Then He touched the man’s ear and healed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025917"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come to arrest him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous criminal?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025918"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I was with you every day in the temple, you did not lay a hand on me. But now is your time, and the authority of darkness prevails.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025919"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they seized him, led him away, and brought him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025920"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and gathered around it, Peter sat down among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025921"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But a certain servant girl saw him as he sat by the fire, and she looked intently at him and said, "This man was also with him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025922"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025923"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After a short time, someone else noticed him and said, “You are one of them too!” But Peter replied, “Sir, I am not.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025924"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">About an hour later, another person insisted with certainty, saying, "Truly, this man was also with him, for he is a Galilean."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025925"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter replied, "Sir, I don't understand what you're saying." And at that very moment, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025926"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Lord turned and looked directly at Peter. At that moment, Peter remembered the words the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025927"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter went outside and wept deeply, overcome with sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025928"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">63 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The men who were holding Jesus mocked him and struck him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025929"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">64 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and demanded, "Prophesy! Tell us who hit you!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025930"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">65 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they spoke many other things against him, uttering blasphemies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025931"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">66 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as morning came, the elders of the people, along with the chief priests and the scribes, gathered together and brought Him before their council, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025932"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">67 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Are you the Messiah? Tell us." And he replied to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025933"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">68 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if I were to ask you, you would not answer me, nor would you release me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025934"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">69 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025935"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">70 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" And he replied to them, "You say that I am."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025936"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">71 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth."</span></p>
