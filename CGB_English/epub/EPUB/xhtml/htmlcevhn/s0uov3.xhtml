<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027223"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Trembling and overwhelmed, he said, “Lord, what do you want me to do?” The Lord replied, “Get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027237"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, he began proclaiming Christ in the synagogues, declaring that he is the Son of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027238"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All who heard him were astonished and said, "Isn’t this the man who caused havoc in Jerusalem for those who called on this name? Didn’t he come here with the purpose of arresting them and bringing them bound to the chief priests?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027239"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Saul grew even more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by demonstrating that Jesus was indeed the Messiah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027240"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After many days had passed, the Jewish leaders plotted to kill him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027241"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, Saul became aware of their plot.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027242"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">That night, the disciples took him and lowered him down along the city wall in a basket.</span></p>

However, they were all afraid of him and could not believe that he was truly a disciple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027244"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him. He also described how Saul had boldly preached in Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027245"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he stayed with them, moving freely in and out of Jerusalem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027254"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">During that time, she became ill and passed away.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027256"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing him the robes and garments that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027257"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter asked everyone to leave the room, then knelt down and prayed.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027258"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet.
