<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024409"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left that place and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024410"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Sabbath day arrived, He began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard Him were amazed and asked, "Where does this man get such knowledge? What kind of wisdom has been given to Him? How is it that such powerful deeds are performed by His hands?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024411"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024412"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024413"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he was unable to perform any significant miracles there, except that he placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024414"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he was astonished at their lack of faith. Then he traveled around the nearby villages, continuing to teach.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024415"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus summoned the twelve disciples and began to send them out in pairs, granting them authority to drive out impure spirits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bag, no bread, no money in their belts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024417"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Wear sandals on your feet, but do not take an extra coat with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024418"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your message, as you leave that place, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. Truly I tell you, on the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went out and proclaimed that people should turn away from their sins and change their ways.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They drove out many demons and anointed many who were sick with oil, bringing them healing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024422"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">King Herod heard about Jesus, for His name had become widely known. Herod said, "This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead, and that is why such miraculous powers are at work in Him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024423"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some people said, "He is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024424"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Herod heard about this, he said, "This is John, the one I beheaded. He has been raised from the dead."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024425"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For Herod himself had sent his men to arrest John and had him bound and imprisoned because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, whom Herod had married.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to have him killed, but she was unable to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When Herod listened to John, he was deeply perplexed, yet he heard him gladly and often acted upon his words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When an opportune day arrived, Herod held a banquet on his birthday for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading officials of Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the daughter of Herodias entered and performed a dance, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. The king then said to the young woman, "Ask me for whatever you desire, and I will give it to you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024431"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, even up to half of my kingdom."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024432"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She went out and asked her mother, "What should I request?" Her mother replied, "The head of John the Baptist."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024433"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She immediately went with haste to the king and made her request, saying, "I want you to give me right now, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024434"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oath and out of respect for those who were dining with him, he did not want to refuse her request.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024435"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At once, the king sent a guard and ordered him to bring John’s head.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024436"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They placed his head on a platter and presented it to the young woman, who then gave it to her mother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024437"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When his disciples heard about what had happened, they came and took his body, placing it in a tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The apostles came together to Jesus and reported to him everything they had done and taught.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024439"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest for a while." For there were so many people coming and going that they did not even have time to eat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024440"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They left by boat to go to a secluded, deserted place by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024441"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people saw them leaving, and many recognized Jesus.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024442"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus came out and saw the large crowd, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024443"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the day was drawing to a close, his disciples approached him and said, "This is a remote place, and the hour is already late."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024444"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Send them away so they can go into the surrounding countryside and nearby villages to buy food for themselves, because they have nothing to eat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024445"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He responded to them, saying, "You give them something to eat."

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024446"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024447"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024448"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They arranged themselves in groups, sitting in orderly rows, some in groups of a hundred and others in groups of fifty.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024451"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They gathered up twelve baskets full of the leftover pieces of bread and fish.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024453"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, Jesus urged his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, toward Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024454"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After dismissing them, he went up into the hills to pray.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024455"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When evening arrived, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the shore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024456"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He saw them struggling as they rowed, for the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea, and intended to pass by them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024457"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost and cried out in fear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024458"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For they all saw him and were filled with alarm. But at once he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024459"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024460"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024461"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had crossed over, they arrived in the region of Gennesaret and approached the shore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024462"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they got out of the boat, they immediately recognized Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024463"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went throughout the entire surrounding region and started bringing the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024464"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Wherever he went—whether into villages, towns, or the countryside—people would bring the sick out into the open spaces and beg him to let them touch even the edge of his clothing. And all who touched him were healed.</span></p>
