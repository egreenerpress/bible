<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026673"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"And where I am going, you know, and the way to it you also know."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026674"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026675"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "I am the path, the truth, and the source of life.

But from now on, you do know Him, and you have seen Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026677"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026678"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for such a long time, and still you do not know me, Philip?

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026679"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you are not spoken on my own authority, but the Father, who dwells within me, is the one doing the works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026680"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Trust that I am united with the Father, and the Father is united with me. If you cannot believe this based on my words alone, then believe because of the works I have done.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026681"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I am doing. In fact, they will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026682"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, so that the Father may be honored through the Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026683"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you ask for anything in my name, I will do it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026684"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you truly love me, you will follow and obey my instructions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026685"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, who will remain with you forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026686"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, because it does not see Him or recognize Him. But you know Him, because He remains with you and will be within you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026687"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will not abandon you as orphans; I will come to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026688"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In a short time, the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026689"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that day, you will understand that I am united with the Father, and you are united with me, and I am united with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026690"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who truly loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them as well, and I will reveal myself to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026691"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, “Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself to us, but not to the world?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026692"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied to him, "If anyone loves me, they will obey my teachings. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026693"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever does not love me does not follow my teachings. And the message you hear is not from me, but from the Father who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026694"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"I have told you these things while I am still here with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026695"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the Helper, who is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026696"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I leave you with peace; my own peace I give to you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not be afraid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026697"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have heard me say to you, "I am going away, and I will return to you." If you truly loved me, you would rejoice because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026698"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have told you about these things beforehand, so that when they happen, you may believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026699"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From now on, I will not speak much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me, for there is nothing in me that belongs to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026700"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But this is so that the world may understand that I love the Father and that I am doing exactly as the Father has commanded me. Come, let us leave this place and go forward.</span></p>
