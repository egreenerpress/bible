<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025520"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, some people came and told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025521"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Do you think these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025522"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025523"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Or what about those eighteen people who were killed when the tower in Siloam collapsed? Do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025524"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025525"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus also told this parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it but found none."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025526"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to the caretaker of his vineyard, "Look, for three years now I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have found none. Cut it down! Why should it continue to deplete the soil?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025527"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man replied, "Master, please leave it alone for one more year. I will dig around it and fertilize the soil."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025528"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If it produces fruit, that is good. But if it does not, then afterward you should cut it down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025529"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025530"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And look, there was a woman who had been afflicted by a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and completely unable to straighten herself up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025531"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw her, he called her to come to him and said, "Woman, you are now freed from your ailment."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025532"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed his hands on her, and at once she was made upright again. Then she praised God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The leader of the synagogue, filled with anger because Jesus had healed someone on the Sabbath, responded by saying to the crowd, "There are six days in the week when work is permitted. Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025534"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Lord responded to him, saying, "You hypocrite! Does not every one of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall on the Sabbath and lead it out to give it water?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025535"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be released from this bondage on the Sabbath day?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025536"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had spoken these words, all his opponents were put to shame, and the entire crowd rejoiced over all the magnificent things that he had accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025537"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then He said, "What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025538"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is like a mustard seed, which a person took and planted in their garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky came and made nests in its branches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025539"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And again He said, "To what can I compare the kingdom of God?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025540"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is like yeast, which a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025541"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He traveled through towns and villages, teaching as he went, making his way toward Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025542"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He replied to them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025543"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Make every effort to enter through the narrow gate, for I tell you that many will try to enter but will not be able to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025544"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once the master of the house has gotten up and locked the door, and you begin to stand outside, knocking on the door and pleading, "Lord, Lord, open the door for us," he will respond and say to you, "I do not know where you are from."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025545"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, you will start to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025546"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he will respond, ‘I tell you plainly, I do not know where you come from. Leave me, all of you who practice wrongdoing.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025547"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are cast out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025548"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">People will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and they will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025549"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully: those who are now considered last will one day be first, and those who are now considered first will one day be last.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025550"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that same day, some Pharisees came to Him and said, "Leave this place and go elsewhere, for Herod intends to kill you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025551"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Listen, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my fulfillment.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025552"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet I must continue my journey today, tomorrow, and the following day, for it is unthinkable that a prophet should meet his end anywhere but in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025553"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I longed to gather your people together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025554"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully: your house is now abandoned and left desolate. Truly, I tell you, you will not see me again until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’</span></p>
