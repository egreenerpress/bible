<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025993"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the first day of the week, at the earliest light of dawn, they went to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared, along with some others who accompanied them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025994"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025995"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went inside and discovered that the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025996"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they stood there, deeply puzzled about what had happened, suddenly two men appeared beside them, dressed in radiant clothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025997"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why are you searching for the living among the dead?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025998"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"He is not here; he has risen. Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025999"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and on the third day rise again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026000"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they recalled what he had said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026001"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven apostles and to all the others.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026002"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The women who reported these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026003"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Their words appeared to them as meaningless stories, and they did not believe what was said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026004"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Bending down to look inside, he saw the linen burial cloths lying there by themselves. He left, marveling to himself about what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026005"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And look, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026006"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They discussed among themselves all the events that had taken place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026007"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were talking together and discussing these things, Jesus himself approached and began walking with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026008"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026009"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "What kind of conversation is this that you are having with each other as you walk along, looking so downcast?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026010"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of them, named Cleopas, responded, saying to Him, "Are You the only visitor in Jerusalem who is unaware of the events that have taken place there in recent days?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026011"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked them, "What things are you discussing?" They replied, "We are talking about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in both action and speech in the sight of God and all the people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026012"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And how the chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death and had him crucified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026013"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We had hoped that he was the one who would redeem Israel. Moreover, today is the third day since all these events took place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026014"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, some women from our group also amazed us. They went to the tomb early in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026015"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they could not find his body, they returned and reported that they had seen a vision of angels, who declared that he was alive.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026016"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it exactly as the women had described, but they did not see him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026017"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then He said to them, "You are foolish and slow to believe all that the prophets have declared."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026018"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Was it not necessary for the Christ to endure these sufferings and then enter into his glory?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026019"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Starting with the writings of Moses and continuing through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages in all the Scriptures that referred to himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026020"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they approached the village where they were heading, Jesus acted as if he intended to continue traveling further.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026021"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening, and the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026022"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he was sitting at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks for it, broke it, and gave it to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he disappeared from their sight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026024"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they said to each other, "Were not our hearts deeply stirred within us as he spoke with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026025"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that very moment, they got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven disciples gathered together with those who were with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026026"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were saying, "The Lord has truly risen, and he has appeared to Simon."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026027"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They recounted the events that had taken place along the way and how they had recognized him when he broke the bread.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026028"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were speaking these things, Jesus himself appeared among them and said to them, "May peace be with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026029"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they were filled with fear and alarm, thinking they had seen a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026030"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Why are you distressed? And why do doubts and questions arise in your hearts?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026031"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Look at my hands and my feet—it is truly me. Touch me and see for yourselves, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026032"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had finished speaking, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026033"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While they were still disbelieving because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026034"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They offered him a portion of grilled fish and some honeycomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026035"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took it and ate it in their presence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026036"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026037"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then He opened their minds, enabling them to comprehend the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026038"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "This is what is written: The Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day."</span></p>
