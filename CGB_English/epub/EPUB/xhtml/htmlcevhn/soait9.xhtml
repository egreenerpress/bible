<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026259"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Jesus crossed over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026260"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A large crowd followed him because they had witnessed the miracles he performed on those who were sick.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026261"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus ascended a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026262"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Passover, a festival of the Jews, was near.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026263"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd approaching him, he said to Philip, "Where can we buy bread so that these people may eat?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026264"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said this to test him, for he already knew what he intended to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026265"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip replied to him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, for each one to receive even a small portion."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026266"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of His disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026267"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many people?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026268"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was plenty of grass in that place. So the men sat down, numbering about five thousand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026269"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks, he distributed them to the disciples, who then passed them on to those who were seated. He did the same with the fish, giving out as much as they wanted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026270"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they had all eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, "Collect the leftover pieces so that nothing is wasted."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026271"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they gathered the pieces together and filled twelve baskets with the leftover fragments from the five barley loaves, which remained after everyone had eaten.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026272"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When those men witnessed the miraculous sign that Jesus performed, they declared, "This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026273"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus realized that they intended to come and seize him by force to make him their king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself, alone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026274"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As evening approached, his disciples went down to the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026275"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He got into a boat and crossed the sea toward Capernaum. By then, it was already dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026276"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The sea grew turbulent because a powerful wind was blowing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026277"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water, approaching the boat. They were terrified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026278"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026279"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they gladly took him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026280"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that there was no other boat there except the one in which Jesus' disciples had embarked. They also observed that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples but that the disciples had departed alone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026281"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, other boats arrived from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten the bread, after the Lord had given thanks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026282"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the crowd realized that Jesus was no longer there, nor were his disciples, they got into boats and went to Capernaum to search for him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026283"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Teacher, when did you get here?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026284"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Truly, truly, I tell you, you are seeking me not because you saw the miraculous signs, but because you ate the bread and were satisfied."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026285"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not work for the food that spoils and perishes, but instead strive for the food that endures and leads to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal of approval on him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026286"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him, "What must we do to carry out the works God requires?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026287"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "This is the work God requires: that you believe in the one He has sent."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026288"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they said to him, "What sign will you show us, so that we may see it and believe you? What work will you perform?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026289"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Our ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, as it is written: "He gave them bread from heaven to eat."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026290"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026291"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the true bread from God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026292"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they said to Him, "Lord, always give us this bread."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026293"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026294"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I told you that even though you have seen me, you still do not believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026295"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never turn away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026296"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I have come down from heaven, not to carry out my own will, but to do the will of the one who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026297"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the will of the Father who sent me: that I should lose none of those he has given to me, but that I should raise them up on the last day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026298"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the will of the One who sent me: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026299"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish people began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026300"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026301"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Do not complain or argue among yourselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026302"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me; and I will raise them up on the last day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026303"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is written in the prophets, "They will all be taught by God." Therefore, everyone who has listened to the Father and learned from Him comes to me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026304"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one has ever seen the Father, except the one who comes from God—he alone has seen the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026305"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me possesses eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026306"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am the bread that gives life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026307"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, yet they died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026308"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone who eats it will not die.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026309"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live forever. The bread that I will give is my own flesh, which I will offer for the life of the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026310"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jews then began to argue among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026311"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you partake of the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life within you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026312"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever consumes my flesh and drinks my blood possesses eternal life, and I will raise them up on the final day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026313"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026314"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who consumes my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026315"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as the living Father has sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever partakes of me will also live because of me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026316"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the bread that came down from heaven—not like the manna your ancestors ate, for they died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026317"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He spoke these things in the synagogue while teaching in Capernaum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026318"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many of His disciples, upon hearing this, said, "This is a difficult teaching; who can accept it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026319"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus became aware within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, he said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble or take offense?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026320"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What if you were to see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026321"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">63 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is the Spirit that gives life; the flesh is of no benefit. The words I speak to you are Spirit and life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026322"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">64 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, there are some among you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the start who those were who did not believe and who would eventually betray him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026323"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">65 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted to them by My Father."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026324"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">66 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From that moment onward, many of his followers turned away and no longer accompanied him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">67 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also want to leave?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">68 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Simon Peter replied to Him, "Lord, to whom else would we go?

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">69 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We believe and are fully convinced that you are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">70 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, "Did I not choose the twelve of you? Yet one among you is a deceiver."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">71 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was speaking of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who would betray Him, even though he was one of the twelve.</span></p>
