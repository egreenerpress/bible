<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025414"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of the manâ€™s persistent pleading, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025415"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I tell you this: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For everyone who asks receives; and the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</span></p>

Therefore, they will be the ones to judge you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if I am casting out demons by the power of God, then surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions remain secure and undisturbed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, when someone stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, that stronger one will take away all the weapons he relied on and distribute the plunder he had gathered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever is not aligned with me is opposed to me, and whoever does not gather with me causes division.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When an unclean spirit leaves a person, it wanders through arid places, searching for rest but finding none. Then it says, "I will return to the home I left."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025431"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he arrives, he finds it cleaned and put in order.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025432"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself; they enter and settle there, and the final condition of that person becomes worse than it was at first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025433"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and nursed you at her breast."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025434"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he replied, "Truly, those who hear the word of God and obey it are the ones who are blessed."</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment alongside this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025449"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How terrible it will be for you, Pharisees!

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025453"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">How terrible for you!
