<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023794"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023795"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had agreed with the workers to pay them a denarius for the day’s labor, he sent them into his vineyard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023796"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went out again around nine in the morning and noticed others standing in the marketplace without work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023797"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is fair." So they went.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023798"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he went out around noon and again at three in the afternoon, and he did the same as before.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023799"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Around the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around doing nothing. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day without working?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023800"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is fair, you will receive."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023801"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and moving on to the first."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023802"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When those who were hired around the eleventh hour arrived, each one received a denarius.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023803"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, when the first group came forward, they expected to receive more, but each of them also received just one denarius.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023804"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And when they received it, they began to complain against the owner of the household.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023805"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "These last workers have only worked for one hour, yet you have made them equal to us, who have endured the heavy labor and the scorching heat of the entire day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023806"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he responded to one of them, saying, "Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023807"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Take what is yours and go. I will give to this last worker the same as I have given to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023808"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Is it not within my rights to do as I please with what belongs to me? Or are you resentful because I am generous?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023809"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last. For many are invited, but only a few are selected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023810"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Jesus was traveling up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately on the way and said to them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023811"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn Him to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023812"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified; but on the third day, he will rise again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023813"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing down before him and asking a favor of him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023814"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to her, "What do you desire?" She replied to him, "Please grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023815"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus responded, "You do not understand what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or to undergo the baptism with which I am to be baptized?" They replied to Him, "We are able."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023816"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "You will indeed drink from My cup and undergo the baptism with which I am baptized. But to sit at My right hand or at My left is not Mine to grant; it will be given to those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023817"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became deeply upset and angry with the two brothers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023818"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions exercise authority over them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023819"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, this should not be the case among you. Instead, whoever desires to be great among you must become your servant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023820"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whoever desires to be first among you, let them become your servant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023821"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023822"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they left Jericho, a large crowd followed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023823"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Jesus was passing by, two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that it was Jesus, they cried out, saying, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023824"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd scolded them, telling them to be quiet, but they shouted even louder, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023825"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus stopped, called them over, and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023826"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to Him, "Lord, we ask that our eyes may be opened."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023827"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moved with deep compassion, Jesus reached out and touched their eyes. Instantly, their sight was restored, and they began to follow him.</span></p>
