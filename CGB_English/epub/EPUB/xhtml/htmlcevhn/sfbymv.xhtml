<h3 class="index-book-title">I Corinthians Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028435"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Let people regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and entrusted stewards of God's sacred truths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028436"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, it is essential that those entrusted with responsibility prove themselves to be trustworthy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028437"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It matters very little to me whether I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I am not aware of any wrongdoing in myself, yet this does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who examines and judges me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028439"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, do not pass judgment on anything prematurely, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will reveal the secret intentions of the heart. At that time, each person will receive the praise that comes from God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028440"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Brothers and sisters, I have applied these examples to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that through us you might learn not to go beyond what is written in Scripture. This is to prevent any of you from becoming arrogant, favoring one person over another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028441"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who makes you different from anyone else? And what do you have that you did not receive? If you received it, why do you boast as though you did not?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028442"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now you are satisfied, now you are wealthy, you have ruled as kings without us—and I wish it were true that you did reign, so that we might reign alongside you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028443"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I believe that God has displayed us, the apostles, as though we were last in line, destined for death. We have become a public spectacle to the world, to angels, and to humanity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028444"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We may appear foolish for the sake of Christ, but you consider yourselves wise in Christ. We are seen as weak, while you are strong. You are held in honor, but we are treated with contempt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028445"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even up to this very moment, we endure hunger and thirst, lack proper clothing, face physical abuse, and have no permanent place to live.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028446"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We work hard, laboring with our own hands. When we are insulted, we respond with blessings; when we are persecuted, we endure it patiently.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028447"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When we are slandered, we respond with kindness. We are treated as the scum of the earth, the refuse of all things, even to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028448"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am not writing these things to embarrass you, but as a father who loves his children, I am giving you this warning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028449"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Although you may have countless teachers in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028450"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I urge you to imitate me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028451"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you—my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them in every church wherever I go.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028452"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not planning to come to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028453"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will not focus on the words of those who are arrogant, but on the power they demonstrate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028454"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the kingdom of God does not consist in mere words, but in genuine power.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028455"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What do you desire? Should I come to you with a rod of discipline, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</span></p>
