<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023635"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023636"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why do your disciples break the traditions handed down by our ancestors? They do not wash their hands before eating bread.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023637"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus responded to them, saying, "Why do you break God's commandment because of your traditions?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023638"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God has commanded, saying, "Honor your father and mother," and, "Whoever speaks evil of their father or mother must be put to death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023639"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But you say, ‘If anyone declares to his father or mother, “What you might have gained from me is now dedicated to God as a gift,”’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023640"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If someone does not honor their father or mother, they are released from their obligation. In this way, you have nullified the commandment of God by your traditions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023641"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied accurately about you when he said..."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023642"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This people approaches me with their words and honors me with their speech, but their hearts are distant from me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023643"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, their worship of me is meaningless, as they teach human rules as if they were divine instructions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023644"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus gathered the crowd and said to them, "Listen carefully and grasp the meaning of what I am saying."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023645"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is not what enters the mouth that makes a person unclean, but what comes out of the mouth—this is what defiles a person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023646"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then His disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard what You said?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023647"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023648"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Leave them be; they are blind guides leading the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023649"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter responded and said to him, "Explain to us the meaning of this parable."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023650"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said, "Do you still not understand?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023651"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you still not understand that whatever enters through the mouth passes into the stomach and is later expelled as waste?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023652"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the words that come out of a person’s mouth originate from the heart, and it is these things that make a person unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023653"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For from within the heart come evil intentions, acts of murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023654"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These are the things that make a person unclean, but eating with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023655"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus left that place and traveled to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023656"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023657"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he did not respond to her at all. Then his disciples approached him and urged him, saying, "Send her away, because she keeps calling out after us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023658"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he replied, "I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the people of Israel."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023659"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then she approached Him, bowed down in reverence, and pleaded, "Lord, help me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023660"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he responded, "It is not right to take the bread meant for the children and throw it to the dogs."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023661"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She replied, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023662"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus responded and said to her, "Woman, your faith is truly remarkable. Let it be done for you as you desire." And from that very moment, her daughter was healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023663"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus left that place and went to the region near the Sea of Galilee. He climbed a mountainside and sat down there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023664"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Large crowds gathered around him, bringing with them people who were lame, blind, mute, disabled, and many others with various ailments. They laid them at Jesus’ feet, and he healed them all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023665"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd was utterly amazed when they witnessed those who had been unable to speak now speaking, those who had been crippled now made whole, those who had been lame now walking, and those who had been blind now seeing. As a result, they praised and honored the God of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023666"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I feel deep concern for this crowd, because they have stayed with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on their journey."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023667"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And His disciples said to Him, "Where could we possibly get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a large crowd?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023668"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven, and a few small fish."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023669"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023670"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples. The disciples then distributed the food to the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023671"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up the leftover pieces of bread, filling seven baskets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023672"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The number of those who ate was four thousand men, not including women and children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023673"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After dismissing the crowd, he boarded a boat and traveled to the region of Magdala.</span></p>
