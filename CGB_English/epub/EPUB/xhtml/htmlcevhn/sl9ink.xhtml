<h3 class="index-book-title">Acts Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Saul approved of his execution. At that time, a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all the believers, except for the apostles, were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And pious men took Stephen’s body to be buried, and they mourned deeply for him with great sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As for Saul, he violently persecuted the church, going from house to house, dragging out both men and women and throwing them into prison.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As a result, those who had been dispersed traveled far and wide, proclaiming the message of the word.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip then traveled to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the message of Christ to the people there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people were united in their attention to the things Philip was saying, as they both heard his words and witnessed the miraculous signs he performed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For unclean spirits, shouting with loud cries, came out of many who were possessed by them, and many who were afflicted with paralysis and those who were lame were healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there was immense joy throughout that city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a man named Simon who had previously practiced sorcery in that city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone extraordinary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everyone, from the least to the greatest, paid close attention to him, saying, "This man is the mighty power of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed and captivated them with his magical practices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they heard Philip proclaiming the message about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they came to believe. As a result, both men and women were baptized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Simon himself also came to believe, and after he was baptized, he stayed with Philip. He was filled with amazement as he observed the miracles and signs that were being performed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted the message of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived, they prayed for them, asking that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For at that time, the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027195"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027196"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Grant me this authority as well, so that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027197"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter said to him, "May your money be destroyed along with you, because you believed that God’s gift could be bought with money."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027198"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have no share or portion in this matter, because your heart is not sincere before God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027199"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Turn away from this evil you have done, and pray to God, so that perhaps the intention of your heart may be forgiven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027200"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I see that you are deeply entrenched in bitterness and bound by the chains of sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027201"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Simon replied, saying, "Please pray to the Lord for me, so that none of the things you have spoken about will happen to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027202"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem and continued to preach the good news in many Samaritan villages.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027203"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Get up and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza—the desert road."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027204"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So he got up and went. There he encountered an Ethiopian man, a high-ranking official in the service of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasury and had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027205"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was on his way back, seated in his chariot, reading from the prophet Isaiah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027206"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and approach this chariot."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027207"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip hurried over to him and heard him reading from the prophet Isaiah. He asked, "Do you understand what you're reading?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027208"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man replied, "How can I understand unless someone explains it to me?" Then he urged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027209"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The passage of Scripture he was reading was this: "He was led like a sheep to be slaughtered, and just as a lamb is silent before its shearer, he did not open his mouth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027210"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In his humiliation, justice was denied him; and who can fully describe his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027211"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The eunuch responded to Philip, saying, "Please tell me, who is the prophet referring to in this passage? Is he speaking about himself, or about someone else?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027212"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Philip began to speak, starting from that very Scripture, and proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027213"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they continued on their journey, they came to a body of water. The eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What is preventing me from being baptized?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027214"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, it is permitted." The man replied, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027215"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water. Then Philip baptized him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027216"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, so that the eunuch no longer saw him. The eunuch continued on his journey, filled with joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027217"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Philip was discovered in Azotus, and as he traveled through the region, he proclaimed the message in every town until he reached Caesarea.</span></p>
