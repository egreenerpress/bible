<h3 class="index-book-title">Ecclesiastes Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There is a troubling thing I have observed in this world, and it is widespread among people:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man to whom God has granted riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, yet God does not enable him to enjoy it—instead, a stranger consumes it. This is meaningless, and it is a grievous affliction.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the length of his days is great, yet his soul is not satisfied with goodness, and he does not even receive a proper burial, I declare that a stillborn child is better off than he.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017422"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he enters life with emptiness and departs in obscurity, and his name will be shrouded in darkness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017423"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, this one has never seen the sun or experienced anything; it finds greater peace than the other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017424"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even if someone lives for two thousand years, they will still not experience true fulfillment or lasting good. In the end, do not all people go to the same place—the grave?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017425"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the toil of a person is for their own sustenance, yet their hunger is never fully satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What advantage does the wise person have over the fool? What does the poor person gain, even if they know how to conduct themselves in life?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is better to be content with what you can see than to constantly chase after what you desire. This too is meaningless and a chasing after the wind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What has already happened has been determined, and it is clear that it concerns humanity. No one can challenge or contend with the one who is far greater and more powerful than they are.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Given that there are many things that only add to emptiness and futility, what real benefit does a person gain?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who truly knows what is good for a person during their lifetime, throughout the fleeting days of their meaningless life, which passes like a shadow? And who can tell anyone what will happen after they are gone, under the sun?</span></p>
