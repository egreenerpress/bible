<h3 class="index-book-title">I John Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030581"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Consider the extraordinary love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are! The reason the world does not recognize us is that it did not recognize Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030582"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Dear friends, we are now children of God, and what we will become has not yet been revealed. But we know this: when he appears, we will be like him, because we will see him as he truly is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030583"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And everyone who holds this hope within them purifies themselves, just as He is pure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030584"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever commits sin is also breaking the law, because sin is, by definition, the violation of the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030585"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware that he was revealed to remove our sins, and in him there is no sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030586"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever remains in Him does not continue in sin; whoever continues in sin has not truly seen Him or come to know Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030587"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030588"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. This is the very reason the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030589"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever is born of God does not continue in sin, because God's seed remains in them; and they cannot keep on sinning, because they have been born of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030590"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is how the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love their brother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030591"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the message you have heard from the beginning: that we must love one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030592"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own actions were evil, while his brotherâ€™s were righteous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030593"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030594"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are certain that we have transitioned from death to life because we love our fellow believers. Whoever does not love their brother or sister remains in a state of death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030595"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Anyone who harbors hatred toward their brother is, in essence, a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030596"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is how we understand the love of God: He gave up His life for us, and we, in turn, ought to give up our lives for our fellow believers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030597"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if someone possesses the resources of this world and sees a fellow believer in need, yet closes their heart of compassion toward them, how can the love of God truly remain in that person?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030598"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">My dear children, let us not merely express love with words or speech, but let us demonstrate it through genuine actions and sincere truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030599"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">By this we know that we belong to the truth, and we can set our hearts at rest in his presence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030600"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If our own conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030601"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Dear friends, if our conscience does not accuse us, we can approach God with confidence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030602"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we obey His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is His commandment: that we believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, just as He has commanded us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who keeps His commandments remains in union with Him, and He in them. And by this we know that He remains in us: through the Spirit He has given to us.</span></p>
