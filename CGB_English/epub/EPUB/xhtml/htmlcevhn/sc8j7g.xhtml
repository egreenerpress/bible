<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022938"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I turned and raised my eyes, and as I looked, I saw a flying scroll.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022939"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a flying scroll; it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022940"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to me, "This is the curse that spreads out over the entire earth: everyone who steals will be punished as described here, and everyone who swears falsely will be punished as described there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022941"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will bring it to pass, declares the LORD of hosts, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain within their house and consume it, along with its timbers and stones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022942"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Look up now and see what this is that is coming forth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022943"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I asked, "What is this?" He replied, "This is a measuring basket that is moving forward." Then he added, "This represents their appearance and influence throughout the entire earth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022944"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I looked, and there was a heavy lead cover being lifted up. Inside the basket sat a woman.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022945"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "This represents wickedness." Then he threw it into the center of the measuring basket and placed the heavy lead weight over its opening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022946"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, two women were coming forward, with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted the ephah up between the earth and the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022947"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking this ephah?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022948"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to me, "To build a house for it in the land of Shinar. It will be established and placed there on its own foundation."</span></p>
