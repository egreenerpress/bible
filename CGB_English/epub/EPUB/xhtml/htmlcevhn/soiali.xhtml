<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024838"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the chief priests persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released to them instead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024839"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate responded and asked them again, "What then do you want me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"</span></p>
