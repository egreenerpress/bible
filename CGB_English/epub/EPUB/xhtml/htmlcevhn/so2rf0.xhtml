<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000694"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A severe famine struck the land, in addition to the earlier famine that had occurred during Abraham’s time. So Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in the region of Gerar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000695"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land that I will show you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000696"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Live as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. For to you and your descendants, I will give all these lands, and I will fulfill the promise I made by oath to Abraham, your father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000697"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I will cause your descendants to increase in number like the stars of the sky, and I will give all these lands to your offspring. Through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000699"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac settled in Gerar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000700"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The men of that place inquired about his wife, and he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me because of Rebekah, for she is very beautiful."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000701"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After Isaac had lived there for a considerable time, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, happened to look out of a window and saw Isaac affectionately embracing Rebekah, his wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000702"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "It is absolutely clear that she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied to him, "Because I thought, 'I might lose my life because of her.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000703"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Abimelech said, "What have you done to us? One of the people could have easily slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000704"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Abimelech gave a strict command to all his people, saying, "Whoever harms this man or his wife will certainly be put to death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000705"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac planted crops in that land, and in the same year, he reaped a hundredfold harvest. The Lord blessed him abundantly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000706"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man prospered greatly, advancing and increasing in wealth and influence until he became exceedingly powerful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000707"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he owned large flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and a great number of servants, so much so that the Philistines became envious of him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000708"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the wells that his father’s servants had dug during the lifetime of Abraham, his father, the Philistines had blocked up and filled with dirt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000709"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave us, for you have become far more powerful than we are."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000710"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac then left that place and set up his tent in the valley of Gerar, where he settled and made his home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000711"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac reopened the water wells that had been dug during the lifetime of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had filled them in after Abraham’s death. He gave them the same names his father had given them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000712"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered there a well of flowing water.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000713"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, claiming, “The water belongs to us.” So Isaac named the well *Esek* (which means “dispute”), because they had argued with him over it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000714"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They dug another well, and there was conflict over that one as well. So he named it Sitnah, meaning "Hostility" or "Opposition."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000715"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac then moved on from that place and dug another well. This time, there was no dispute over it, so he named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has granted us ample space, and we will thrive in this land."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000716"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he journeyed from there to Beersheba.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000717"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">That same night, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000718"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. He also set up his tent there, and Isaac’s servants dug a well in that place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000719"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar, accompanied by Ahuzzath, one of his close advisors, and Phichol, the commander of his army.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000720"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me now, since you despise me and drove me away from you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000721"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "We clearly see that the LORD is with you. Therefore, we propose that we establish a solemn agreement between us—between you and us—and let us make a binding covenant with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000722"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Please do not harm us, for we have not wronged you, and we have treated you only with kindness, sending you away in peace. You are now blessed by the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000723"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He prepared a meal for them, and they ate and drank together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000724"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They got up early in the morning and made a solemn promise to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000725"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that same day, Isaac’s servants came and informed him about the well they had dug, saying to him, “We have found water.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000726"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he named it Shebah; therefore, the name of the city has been Beersheba to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000727"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</span></p>
