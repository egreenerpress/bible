<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026383"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026384"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Early in the morning, Jesus returned to the temple, and all the people gathered around him. He sat down and began to teach them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026385"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The religious teachers and Pharisees brought to Him a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the gathering.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026386"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026387"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such individuals. But what do you say?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026388"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said this to test him, hoping to find grounds to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and began writing on the ground with his finger, as if he did not hear them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026389"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they persisted in questioning Him, Jesus stood up and said to them, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026390"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he bent down and wrote on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026391"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When those who heard this were confronted by their own conscience, they began to leave one by one, starting with the oldest until the last. Finally, Jesus was left alone, with the woman still standing there in the center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026392"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus stood up and saw no one but the woman, he said to her, "Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026393"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She replied, "No one, Lord." Jesus then said to her, "I do not condemn you either. Go now, and do not continue in sin."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026394"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light that gives life."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026395"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Pharisees then said to him, "You are testifying about yourself; your testimony is not valid."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026396"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026397"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You make judgments based on outward appearances and human standards; I do not judge anyone in that way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026398"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And even if I were to pass judgment, my judgment would be valid, because I am not acting on my own, but I and the Father who sent me are united in this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026399"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is also written in your law that the testimony of two witnesses is valid and trustworthy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026400"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me also testifies about me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026401"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus replied, "You do not know Me, nor do you know My Father. If you had truly known Me, you would have known My Father as well."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026402"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus spoke these words in the treasury area as he was teaching in the temple. Yet no one attempted to seize him, because his appointed time had not yet arrived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026403"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going, you cannot come."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026404"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Jewish leaders said, "Is he going to kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026405"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not belong to this world."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026406"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I have told you that you will die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will die in your sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026407"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him, “Who are you?” Jesus replied, “I am the one I have always claimed to be from the very start.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026408"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have much to say and to judge concerning you, but the one who sent me is truthful, and I declare to the world the things I have heard from him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026409"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not realize that he was speaking to them about the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026410"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "When you have raised up the Son of Man, you will know that I am who I claim to be, and that I do nothing on my own authority. I speak only what the Father has taught me to say."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026411"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who sent me is with me; the Father has not abandoned me, for I always do what pleases him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026412"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he spoke these things, many came to believe in him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026413"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you remain faithful to my teaching, you are truly my disciples."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026414"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you will come to understand the truth, and the truth will set you free.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026415"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be set free'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who practices sin is enslaved to sin."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026417"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A servant does not remain in the household permanently, but the Son remains forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026418"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If the Son sets you free, you will truly be free.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am aware that you are descendants of Abraham, yet you are trying to kill me because my message finds no acceptance within you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am speaking of what I have witnessed in the presence of my Father, and you are doing what you have learned from your father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, “If you were truly Abraham’s children, you would do the things Abraham did.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026422"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I received from God. Abraham did not act in this way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026423"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are doing the works of your father." They replied to him, "We were not born out of immoral relationships; we have one Father—God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026424"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "If God were truly your Father, you would love me, because I have come from God and am here by his authority. I did not come on my own, but he sent me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026425"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why do you not comprehend what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept and truly listen to my message.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You belong to your father, the devil, and you are determined to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the very beginning and has never stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the source of all lies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And because I speak the truth to you, you do not believe me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which of you can prove me guilty of sin? If I am speaking the truth, why do you not believe me?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who belongs to God listens to God’s words. The reason you do not listen is because you do not belong to God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders responded to Him, saying, "Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026431"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "I am not possessed by a demon. I honor my Father, but you dishonor me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026432"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and judges.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026433"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone holds firmly to my teaching, they will never experience death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026434"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders responded to Him, "Now we are certain that You are possessed by a demon! Abraham and the prophets have died, yet You claim that if anyone obeys Your teaching, they will never experience death."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026435"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026436"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "If I seek to bring honor to myself, such honor would be meaningless. It is my Father who honors me—the very one you claim as your God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026437"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You do not truly know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be lying, just as you are. But I do know him, and I faithfully follow his word.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your father Abraham was filled with joy at the prospect of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026439"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders said to him, "You are not even fifty years old, and yet you claim to have seen Abraham?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026440"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham existed, I am."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026441"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus concealed himself and left the temple, passing through the middle of them unnoticed, and went on his way.</span></p>
