<h3 class="index-book-title">II Corinthians Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028991"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I wish to God you could put up with me for a little while, even in my foolishness—yes, please bear with me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028992"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I am deeply concerned for you with a godly concern, because I have pledged you in marriage to one husband, so that I might present you as a pure and faithful bride to Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028993"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I am concerned that, just as the serpent deceived Eve through his cunning, your thoughts might also be led astray from the pure and sincere devotion that belongs to Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028994"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if someone comes and proclaims a different Jesus, one whom we did not proclaim, or if you receive a different spirit, one you did not receive, or a different gospel, one you did not accept, you might easily put up with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028995"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I believe that I am not in any way inferior to the most prominent apostles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028996"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Although I may lack eloquence in speaking, I am not lacking in understanding. Indeed, we have been fully revealed to you in every way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028997"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Have I done something wrong by humbling myself so that you might be lifted up, because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you without charge?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028998"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I accepted financial support from other churches, taking wages from them, in order to serve you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028999"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I was with you and in need, I did not burden anyone for support. The brothers who came from Macedonia provided what I lacked. In every way, I have taken care not to be a burden to you, and I will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029000"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As surely as the truth of Christ is within me, no one will silence me in this boasting throughout the regions of Achaia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029001"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why do I say this? Is it because I do not love you? God knows that is not the case.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029002"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I will continue to do what I am doing, so that I may remove any opportunity for those who are seeking an opportunity to criticize. In this way, they may be exposed as being no different from us in the matters they boast about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029003"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For such individuals are false apostles, dishonest workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029004"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And it is no surprise, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029005"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is not surprising, then, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their final outcome will correspond to their actions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029006"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I repeat, let no one regard me as foolish. But even if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029007"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What I am saying, I do not say as if it were from the Lord, but rather as if speaking foolishly, in this boldness of boasting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029008"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since many boast about their outward achievements and human accomplishments, I too will boast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029009"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You tolerate foolish people with ease, since you yourselves are so wise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029010"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You tolerate it when someone enslaves you, exploits you, takes advantage of you, elevates themselves above you, or even strikes you in the face.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029011"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am speaking in terms of what others might consider shameful, as if we had been weak. Yet, in whatever way someone else dares to boast—though I am speaking foolishly—I also dare to boast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029012"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are they Hebrews? I am as well. Are they Israelites? I am too. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029013"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind) I am even more so—in far greater labors, in countless beatings, in frequent imprisonments, and often facing death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029014"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was beaten by the Jews five times, each time receiving thirty-nine lashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029015"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, and for a full day and night I was adrift in the open sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029016"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have traveled often, faced dangers from raging waters, threats from robbers, risks from my own people, hazards from foreigners, perils in the city, dangers in the wilderness, threats on the sea, and risks from false believers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029017"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Through exhaustion and hardship, through sleepless nights, through hunger and thirst, through frequent times of fasting, through cold and lack of clothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029018"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In addition to all the external challenges I face, there is the constant burden I carry every day—the deep concern for all the churches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029019"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who is struggling, and I do not share in their struggle? Who is led into sin, and my heart does not burn with concern?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029020"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I must boast, I will boast about the things that reveal my weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029021"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is eternally blessed, knows that I am not lying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029022"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Damascus, the governor appointed by King Aretas stationed guards to control the city of the Damascenes, intending to capture me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100029023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was lowered in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from his grasp.</span></p>
