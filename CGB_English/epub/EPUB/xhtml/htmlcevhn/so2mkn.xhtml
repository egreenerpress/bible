<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027262"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man of deep faith, who revered God along with his entire household, generously gave to those in need, and continually sought God in prayer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027263"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He clearly saw in a vision, around the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming to him and saying, “Cornelius.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027264"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he saw him, he was filled with fear and said, “What is it, Lord?” The angel replied, “Your prayers and your acts of charity have ascended as a remembrance before God.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027265"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon, who is also called Peter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027266"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He is staying with a man named Simon, who is a tanner, and his house is located by the seashore. He will tell you what you need to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027267"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the angel who had spoken to Cornelius left, he summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was one of his regular attendants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027268"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After he had explained all these matters to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027269"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, as they continued their journey and approached the city, Peter went up to the rooftop to pray at about noon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027270"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He became extremely hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing the food, he fell into a visionary state.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027271"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he saw heaven opened, and a certain object descending toward him, like a large sheet bound at its four corners, being lowered to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027272"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In it were all kinds of four-legged animals of the earth, wild animals, crawling creatures, and birds of the sky.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027273"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then a voice spoke to him, saying, "Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027274"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter replied, "Certainly not, Lord! I have never eaten anything that is considered impure or unclean."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027275"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the voice spoke to him a second time, saying, "What God has declared clean, you must not consider unclean."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027276"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This happened three times, and then the vessel was taken back up into heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027277"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Peter was deeply perplexed, wondering what the vision he had seen might mean, suddenly the men sent by Cornelius arrived. They had asked for directions to Simon’s house and were now standing at the gate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027278"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They called out and inquired whether Simon, who was also known as Peter, was staying there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027279"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Look, three men are searching for you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027280"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Therefore, rise up, go down, and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027281"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter went down to meet the men who had been sent by Cornelius and said, "I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027282"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man who reveres God and is well-regarded by the entire Jewish community, received a divine warning through a holy angel to summon you to his home and to listen to what you have to say."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027283"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he invited them in and provided them lodging. The next day, Peter set out with them, and some fellow believers from Joppa went along as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027284"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had gathered his relatives and close friends to be there with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027285"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Peter entered, Cornelius went to meet him, fell at his feet, and showed him reverence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027286"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I am only a man like you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027287"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he spoke with him, he entered and found a large group of people gathered together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027288"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "You are aware that it is against our customs for a Jewish man to associate with or visit someone from another nation. But God has shown me that I should not consider any person impure or unclean."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027289"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I came to you without hesitation as soon as I was summoned. Now I ask, for what purpose have you called for me?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027290"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Cornelius replied, "Four days ago, at this very hour, I was fasting. Then, at three in the afternoon, as I was praying in my house, suddenly a man appeared before me, dressed in radiant clothing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027291"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The angel said, "Cornelius, your prayers have been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered before God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027292"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying at the house of Simon, a tanner, by the seaside. When he arrives, he will speak to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027293"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I sent for you right away, and you have done well to come. Now, we are all here in God’s presence, ready to listen to everything the Lord has instructed you to tell us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027294"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter began to speak and said, "Truly, I now understand that God does not show favoritism toward anyone."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027295"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, in every nation, anyone who reveres Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027296"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The message that God sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ—who is Lord over all.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027298"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027299"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We are witnesses to everything He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027302"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He instructed us to proclaim the message to the people and to bear witness that he is the one appointed by God to be the judge of both the living and the dead.</span></p>
