<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026442"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Jesus was walking along, he noticed a man who had been blind since birth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026443"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And his disciples asked him, saying, "Teacher, who sinned—this man or his parents—that he was born blind?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026444"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "It is not that this man sinned, nor his parents, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026445"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I must carry out the works of the One who sent me while it is still day; for the night is coming when no one can work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026446"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As long as I remain in this world, I am the light that illuminates it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026447"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying this, he spat on the ground, mixed the saliva with dirt to make mud, and then spread the mud over the blind man’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026448"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went and washed, and returned able to see.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026449"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a blind beggar said, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026450"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some people said, "This is the one," while others said, "He looks like him." But he himself said, "I am the one."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026451"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they asked him, "How were your eyes opened?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026452"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied, "A man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' So I went, washed, and then I could see."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026453"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him, "Where is he?" He replied, "I do not know."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026454"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had previously been blind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026455"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and restored the man’s sight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026456"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, the Pharisees questioned him about how he had gained his sight. He replied to them, "He applied clay to my eyes, I washed, and now I can see."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026457"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a sinner perform such miraculous signs?" And there was a disagreement among them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026458"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026459"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the Jewish leaders did not believe that the man had been blind and had gained his sight. So they summoned the parents of the man who had received his sight to confirm the matter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026460"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, the one you claim was born blind? How is it that he can now see?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026461"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His parents responded to them, saying, "We know that this is our son, and we are certain that he was born blind."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026462"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, we do not know how it is that he now sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. He is an adult; ask him yourself—he can speak for himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026463"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. For the Jewish leaders had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026464"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So his parents replied, "He is old enough to speak for himself; ask him directly."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026465"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, they summoned the man who had been blind and said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026466"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. But one thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026467"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they asked him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026468"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied to them, "I have already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his followers?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026469"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they insulted him and said, "You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026470"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026471"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man replied to them, "This is truly remarkable: you do not know where he comes from, yet he has opened my eyes!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026472"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We understand that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devoted to God and does His will, God listens to that person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026473"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From the beginning of time, it has never been heard that anyone has opened the eyes of a person born blind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026474"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If this man were not from God, he would not be able to accomplish anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026475"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to him, "You were entirely born in sin, and yet you presume to teach us?" Then they threw him out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026476"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026477"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied, "Who is he, Lord, so that I may believe in him?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026478"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "You have seen him already, and it is he who is speaking with you now."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026479"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Lord, I believe." Then he bowed down in reverence before Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026480"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said, "I have come into this world to bring judgment, so that those who do not see may gain sight, and those who think they see may become blind."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026481"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words and said to Him, “Are we also blind?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026482"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no guilt. But now you claim, 'We can see,' so your guilt remains."</span></p>
