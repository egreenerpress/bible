<h3 class="index-book-title">Romans Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028211"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I ask then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028212"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God has not rejected his people, whom he chose beforehand. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah? It tells how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028213"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Lord, they have slain your prophets and demolished your altars; I am the only one remaining, and now they are seeking to take my life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028214"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But what does God’s response say to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028215"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, even now, there remains a chosen few by God's gracious selection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028216"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If it is by grace, then it is no longer based on works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. But if it is by works, then it is no longer grace; otherwise, work would no longer be work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028217"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What does this mean? Israel has not attained what it was seeking, but those who were chosen have attained it, while the rest were hardened in their hearts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028218"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is written: "God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that cannot see, and ears that cannot hear," and this remains true to this very day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028219"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And David says, "May their table become a snare, a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution for them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028220"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and may their backs be bent continually.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028221"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall completely? Certainly not! Instead, through their failure, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to stir them to jealousy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028222"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now if their stumbling has brought riches to the world, and their loss has brought wealth to the Gentiles, how much greater will their full inclusion bring?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028223"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am speaking to you who are not Jewish, and since I have been appointed as an apostle specifically to the Gentiles, I take great pride in my role and responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028224"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If somehow I might stir up my own people to jealousy and save some of them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028225"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If their rejection has led to the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance bring but life from the dead?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028226"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if the first portion is holy, then the whole batch is also holy; and if the root is holy, so too are the branches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028227"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and now share in the nourishing root and richness of the cultivated olive tree,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028228"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root; rather, the root supports you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028229"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You might then say, "The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028230"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Very well; they were cut off because of their unbelief, and you stand firm through faith. Do not become arrogant, but be cautious and reverent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028231"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if God did not spare the natural branches, be careful that he does not spare you either.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028232"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Consider, then, both the kindness and the sternness of God: sternness toward those who have fallen, but kindness toward you—provided you remain in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028233"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if they do not persist in their unbelief, they too will be grafted back in, for God has the power to graft them in once more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028234"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if you were cut off from a wild olive tree, which is naturally uncultivated, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028235"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be unaware of this divine mystery, so that you do not become arrogant in your own understanding. A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028236"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And so all of Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion, and he will remove ungodliness from Jacob."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028237"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is my covenant with them: when I remove their sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028238"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Regarding the gospel, they are opposed to it for your benefit; but concerning God's chosen people, they are dearly loved because of the promises made to their ancestors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028239"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God’s gifts and His calling are irrevocable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028240"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the past, you did not believe in God, but now you have received mercy because of their unbelief.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028241"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, these have now also not believed, so that through the mercy shown to you, they too may receive mercy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028242"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God has bound all people in disobedience, so that He may show mercy to all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028243"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Oh, the immeasurable depth of the wealth of God’s wisdom and knowledge! How beyond comprehension are His judgments, and how unfathomable His ways!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028244"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who has fully understood the thoughts of the Lord? Or who has ever advised Him or guided His decisions?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028245"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who has ever given to God first, so that God would owe them anything in return?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028246"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everything comes from him, exists through him, and is directed toward him. To him be glory forever. Amen.</span></p>
