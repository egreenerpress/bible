<h3 class="index-book-title">Romans Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028093"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not understand, my fellow believers—for I am speaking to those who are familiar with the law—that the law has authority over a person only as long as they live?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028094"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For a woman who is married is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the legal obligation to her husband.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028095"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, if a woman marries another man while her husband is still alive, she will be considered an adulteress. However, if her husband has died, she is released from that law and is no longer bound by it. In that case, she is not an adulteress, even if she marries another man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028096"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you too have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another—to him who was raised from the dead—in order that we might bear fruit for God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028097"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When we were controlled by our sinful nature, the passions and desires stirred up by the law were at work within us, producing actions that led to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028098"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now we have been set free from the law, having died to that which once held us captive, so that we may serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of written regulations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028099"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What then should we conclude? Is the law sinful? Absolutely not! Indeed, I would not have recognized sin except through the law. For I would not have understood what it means to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028100"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, sin, seizing the opportunity presented by the commandment, produced in me every kind of desire. For apart from the law, sin was inactive.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028101"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a time when I lived without being fully aware of the law, and I felt alive. But when the commandment came to my understanding, sin sprang to life, and I realized I was spiritually dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028102"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The commandment, which was intended to bring life, I discovered instead led to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028103"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the commandment, deceived me and, through it, brought about my death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028104"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, the law is sacred, and the commandment is sacred, righteous, and good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Does this mean that what is good has become a source of death for me? Certainly not! But sin, in order to be recognized as sin, used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment, sin might be exposed as utterly sinful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we understand that the law is spiritual, but I am bound by my human nature, enslaved to sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028107"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What I do, I do not approve of; for I do not practice what I desire to do, but instead, I do the very thing I hate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I do what I do not desire to do, I acknowledge that the law is good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So now, it is no longer I who am doing this, but the sin that resides within me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I am aware that nothing good dwells within me—that is, within my sinful nature. Though the desire to do what is right is present in me, I find myself unable to carry it out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The good that I desire to do, I do not do; but the evil that I do not want to do, that is what I do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin that resides within me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I discover this principle: when I desire to do what is good, evil is right there with me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I find joy in God's law within my innermost being.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I perceive a different principle at work within me, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin that resides in my bodily nature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Oh, how miserable I am! Who will rescue me from this body doomed to death?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I give thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh, I serve the law of sin.</span></p>
