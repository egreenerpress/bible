<h3 class="index-book-title">Hebrews Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030016"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, let us be cautious and reverent, so that none of you may appear to fall short of reaching the promised rest, since the opportunity to enter into His rest still remains for us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030017"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The good news was proclaimed to us just as it was to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not united with faith in those who listened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030018"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For those of us who have believed do enter into rest, just as God said, "As I swore in my anger, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" even though his works were completed from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030019"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For in one place it is written concerning the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030020"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And again, in this place, it is said: "If they will enter into my rest."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030021"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, since it remains that some must enter into it, and those who first received the promise did not enter because of their lack of faith,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030022"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, God designates a specific day, referring to it in the words of David, "Today, after such a long time," as it is written, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if Joshua had truly provided them with rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030024"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, a Sabbath rest still remains for the people of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030025"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever has entered into God's rest has also ceased from their own labors, just as God rested from His works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030026"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, let us make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030027"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030028"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There is no creature hidden from His sight; everything is completely exposed and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030029"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030030"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in every way just as we areâ€”yet he remained without sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030031"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</span></p>
