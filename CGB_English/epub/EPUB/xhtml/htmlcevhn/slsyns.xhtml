<h3 class="index-book-title">Isaiah Chapter 39</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018414"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah. He had heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018415"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Hezekiah welcomed them warmly and showed them the storehouses of his valuable possessionsâ€”the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oils, the armory, and everything in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace or throughout his entire kingdom that Hezekiah did not display to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They have come to me from a distant land, all the way from Babylon."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018417"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah replied, "They have seen everything in my palace. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018418"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to the word of the LORD of hosts:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully, the time is coming when everything in your household, and all that your ancestors have stored up until now, will be taken away to Babylon. Not a single thing will remain, declares the LORD.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your own sons, who will be born to you, will be taken away; and they will serve as eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100018421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." He also said, "For there will be peace and stability in my days."</span></p>
