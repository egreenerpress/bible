<h3 class="index-book-title">Mark Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once again, Jesus began to teach by the seaside. A large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down on the water, while the entire crowd remained on the shore by the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He taught them many lessons using parables and said to them in his teaching,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen carefully; Look, a farmer went out to scatter seed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he was sowing the seed, some of it fell along the path, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of the seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow, but it lacked depth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the sun rose, the plants were scorched by its heat; and because they had no deep roots, they withered and died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some of the seed fell among thorny plants, and as the thorns grew and spread, they choked the seed, so that it could not produce any fruit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Other seeds fell on good soil, where they took root, grew, and produced a harvest—some yielding thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was sown.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Whoever has the ability to understand, let them pay attention and comprehend."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus was alone, those who were close to him, along with the twelve disciples, asked him about the meaning of the parable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "To you it has been granted to understand the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those on the outside, everything is conveyed in parables."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that even though they see, they may not truly comprehend; and though they hear, they may not fully understand; otherwise, they might turn back and be forgiven for their sins.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who sows is spreading the message.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024339"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan comes at once and takes away the word that was planted in their hearts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024340"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024341"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They have no deep roots within themselves, and so they last only for a short time. Later, when trouble or persecution comes because of the message, they quickly fall away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024342"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"And these are the ones sown among thorns: they are those who hear the word..."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024343"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The worries of this life, the deceptive allure of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and overwhelm the word, causing it to become unfruitful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024344"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And these are the ones sown on good soil: they are those who hear the word, accept it, and produce a harvest—some yielding thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times as much.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024345"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be placed under a basket or under a bed? Is it not meant to be put on a lampstand?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024346"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be made known. What has been kept secret is meant to be brought into the open.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024347"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone has the ability to understand, let them listen carefully.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024348"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Be careful about what you listen to. The standard you use to judge others will be the standard applied to you, and those who listen carefully will receive even more understanding."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024349"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever has [understanding, resources, or faith], more will be given to them; but whoever lacks these, even what little they have will be taken away from them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024350"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said, "The kingdom of God is like this: it is as if a man scatters seed on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024351"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He goes to sleep at night and rises in the morning, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not understand how it happens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024352"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The earth produces crops on its own: first the sprout appears, then the stalk, and finally the mature grain in the head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024353"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the grain is ripe, he immediately swings the sickle, for the time of harvest has arrived.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024354"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God? What illustration or analogy can we use to describe it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024355"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is like a mustard seed, which, when planted in the ground, is smaller than all the other seeds in the soil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024356"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when it is planted, it grows and becomes larger than all other plants, sending out large branches so that the birds of the sky can nest in its shade.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024357"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He spoke the word to them using many such parables, in a way that they could understand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024358"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus always used parables when speaking to the crowds, but when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them clearly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024359"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that same day, when evening had come, He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024360"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After dismissing the crowd, they took Jesus with them in the boat just as he was. Other small boats were also accompanying them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024361"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A powerful windstorm arose, and the waves crashed against the boat, causing it to fill with water.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024362"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He was in the stern of the boat, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and said, "Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024363"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus stood up and commanded the wind, saying, "Be silent!" And to the sea, he said, "Be still!" Immediately, the wind stopped blowing, and the sea became completely calm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024364"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you still lack trust?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024365"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were utterly terrified and said to one another, "Who is this man, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</span></p>
