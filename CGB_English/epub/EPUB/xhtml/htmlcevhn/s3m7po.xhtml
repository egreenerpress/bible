<h3 class="index-book-title">II John Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030647"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I truly love—and not I alone, but also all who have come to know the truth—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030648"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the sake of the truth that resides within us and will remain with us forever.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030649"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">May grace, mercy, and peace be with you, given by God the Father and by the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030650"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was filled with great joy to find that some of your children are living in accordance with the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030651"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now I urge you, dear lady, not as though I am writing a new commandment to you, but rather reminding you of what we have had from the beginning: that we should love one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030652"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is what love truly means: that we live according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should live in this way.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030653"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many false teachers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in human form. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030654"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Be careful to guard yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but instead receive the full reward that is due.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030655"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Anyone who goes beyond the boundaries and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. But whoever remains faithful to the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030656"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome them into your home or give them any encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030657"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever welcomes him and encourages his actions shares in the responsibility for his wicked deeds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030658"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Though I have much to write to you, I prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and speak with you in person, so that our joy may be complete.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030659"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The children of your chosen sister send you their greetings. Amen.</span></p>
