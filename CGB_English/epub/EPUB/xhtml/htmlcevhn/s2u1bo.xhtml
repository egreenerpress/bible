<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027416"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived in Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large number of people—both Jews and Greeks—came to believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027417"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the Jews who refused to believe incited the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the believers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027418"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For a long time, they stayed there, speaking boldly about the Lord, who confirmed the message of His grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders through their hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027419"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the people of the city were split: some sided with the Jews, while others supported the apostles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027420"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their leaders, launched an attack intending to mistreat and stone them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027421"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They became aware of the danger and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities in Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027422"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there they proclaimed the good news.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027423"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In Lystra, there was a man who had been unable to walk since birth, crippled from his mother’s womb. He had never walked in his life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027424"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man listened to Paul as he spoke. Paul looked intently at him and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027425"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He spoke in a strong voice, "Stand up straight on your feet!" And the man jumped up and began to walk.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027426"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices and exclaimed in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027427"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people called Barnabas "Jupiter" and Paul "Mercury," because Paul was the primary speaker.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027428"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was located at the entrance to their city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates, intending to offer sacrifices along with the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027429"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about this, they tore their clothes in distress and rushed into the crowd, shouting,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027430"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said, "Gentlemen, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings, just like you, and we are here to proclaim to you the good news, urging you to turn away from these empty idols and turn instead to the living God, who created heaven, earth, the sea, and everything in them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027431"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In former times, God allowed all nations to follow their own paths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027432"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet God did not leave Himself without evidence of His presence, for He has shown kindness by giving us rain from the skies and fruitful harvests in their seasons, providing us with food and filling our hearts with joy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027433"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">With these words, they barely managed to stop the people from offering sacrifices to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027434"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, who convinced the crowd to turn against Paul. They stoned him and dragged him out of the city, assuming he was dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027435"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day, he left with Barnabas and traveled to Derbe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027436"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had proclaimed the good news in that city and instructed many people, they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027437"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Strengthening the spirits of the disciples, they encouraged them to remain steadfast in their faith, reminding them that entering the kingdom of God requires enduring many hardships.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027438"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After appointing elders in each church and praying with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had placed their faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027439"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After traveling through Pisidia, they arrived in Pamphylia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027440"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had proclaimed the message in Perga, they traveled down to Attalia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027441"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They then sailed to Antioch, the place from which they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the task they had now completed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027442"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they arrived and gathered the church together, they recounted everything that God had accomplished through them, and how He had opened the way of faith to the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027443"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they stayed there for a considerable period of time with the disciples.</span></p>
