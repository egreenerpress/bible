<h3 class="index-book-title">Isaiah Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017771"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, exalted and lofty, and the hem of His robe filled the temple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Above it stood the seraphim, each having six wings: with two wings they covered their faces, with two wings they covered their feet, and with two wings they flew.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One called out to another, saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the entire earth is filled with His glory."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The doorposts shook at the sound of the one who called out, and the temple was filled with smoke.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017775"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I said, "How terrible it is for me! I am ruined! For I am a man with unclean lips, and I live among a people who also have unclean lips. Yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of armies!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017776"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017777"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He placed it upon my mouth and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is removed, and your sin is atoned for."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017778"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I also heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go on our behalf?" Then I said, "Here I am; send me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017779"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Go and tell this people: 'You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; you will indeed see, but you will not perceive.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017780"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Make the hearts of this people unresponsive, and dull their hearing, and close their eyes; otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, turn back, and be healed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017781"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then I asked, "Lord, how long will this last?" He replied, "Until the cities lie in ruins, empty of inhabitants, and the houses are abandoned, with no one living in them, and the land becomes completely desolate."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017782"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The LORD will cause people to be taken far away, and there will be a vast desolation throughout the land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100017783"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yet a tenth part will remain in it, and it will return and be consumed. Like a terebinth tree or an oak, which retains its core even when its leaves fall, so the holy seed will be the enduring essence within it.</span></p>
