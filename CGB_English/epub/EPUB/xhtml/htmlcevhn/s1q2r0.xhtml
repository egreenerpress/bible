Zelophehad was the son of Hepher, who was the son of Gilead, who was the son of Machir, who was the son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span></p>

Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he left no sons behind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100004559"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why should our father’s name be removed from his family simply because he had no son? Grant us, therefore, a share of land among our father’s relatives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100004560"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Moses presented their case before the LORD.</span></p>
