<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025303"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus gathered His twelve disciples and granted them the power and authority to cast out all demons and to heal diseases.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025304"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to bring healing to those who were ill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025305"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Do not take anything with you for your journey—no walking stick, no bag, no bread, no money, and do not carry an extra tunic."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025306"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you enter any house, stay there until you leave that place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025307"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone refuses to welcome you or listen to your message, as you leave that town, shake the dust from your feet as a sign of judgment against them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025308"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They left and traveled through the towns, proclaiming the good news and bringing healing wherever they went.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025309"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening through him, and he was deeply troubled, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025310"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some were saying that Elijah had appeared, while others claimed that one of the ancient prophets had risen again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025311"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Herod said, "I had John beheaded. But who is this person about whom I hear such reports?" And he wanted to see Him for himself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025312"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The apostles, upon their return, reported to Jesus everything they had accomplished. Then, taking them with him, he withdrew privately to a secluded area near the city called Bethsaida.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025313"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the people became aware of his presence, they followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who were in need of healing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025314"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the day started to draw to a close, the twelve disciples came to Him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the nearby villages and countryside to find lodging and food, for we are in a remote place here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025315"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They replied, "We have nothing here except five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025316"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There were approximately five thousand men present. Then Jesus instructed his disciples, "Have the people sit down in groups of about fifty each."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025317"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did as instructed and had everyone sit down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025318"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and blessed them. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025319"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They all ate and were fully satisfied. Afterward, they gathered up the leftover pieces, filling twelve baskets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025320"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was praying by himself, his disciples were nearby. He asked them, "Who do people say that I am?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025321"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025322"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter replied, "You are the Messiah, the Anointed One of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025323"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he sternly instructed them, commanding them not to tell anyone about this matter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025324"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "The Son of Man must endure great suffering, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, be put to death, and then be raised to life on the third day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025325"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to all of them, "If anyone desires to follow me, they must deny their own self-interest, take up their cross every day, and follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025326"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever seeks to preserve their own life will ultimately lose it; but whoever is willing to give up their life for my sake will truly save it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025327"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What benefit does a person gain if they acquire the entire world but forfeit their own soul or bring ruin upon themselves?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025328"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone is ashamed of me and my teachings, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of them when he comes in his own glory, in the glory of his Father, and in the glory of the holy angels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025329"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I assure you with certainty, there are some standing here who will not experience death until they witness the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025330"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">About eight days after Jesus spoke these words, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025331"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he prayed, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothing became dazzling white, shining brilliantly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025332"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, two men appeared and began speaking with him. These men were Moses and Elijah.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025333"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025334"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter and those with him were weighed down by sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025335"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, "Teacher, it is wonderful for us to be here. Let us set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He said this without fully understanding what he was saying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025336"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, casting its shadow over them. They were filled with awe as they entered into the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025337"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025338"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. They kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone in those days about the things they had witnessed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025339"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The next day, as they were coming down from the hill, a large crowd came to meet him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025340"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you, please look at my son, for he is my only child.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025341"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Suddenly, a spirit seizes him, and he cries out abruptly. It throws him into convulsions, causing him to foam at the mouth, and after severely tormenting him, it finally leaves him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025342"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I pleaded with your disciples to drive the spirit out of him, but they were unable to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025343"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded, saying, "O unbelieving and corrupt generation, how much longer must I remain with you and endure you? Bring your son here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025344"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the boy was still approaching, the demon threw him to the ground and violently convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and returned him to his father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025345"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everyone was astonished at the overwhelming power of God. Yet, as they marveled at all the things Jesus had done, he turned to his disciples and said,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025346"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Let these words deeply penetrate your understanding: for the Son of Man will be handed over into the power of men.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025347"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, they did not comprehend the meaning of this statement, and its significance was concealed from them, so they could not grasp it. They were afraid to ask Him about what He had said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025348"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered the greatest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025349"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their hearts, took a child and had him stand beside Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025350"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is considered the least among you all—that person will be great."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025351"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John responded, saying, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow along with us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025352"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for whoever is not opposing us is supporting us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025353"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set his face toward Jerusalem, determined to go there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025354"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent messengers ahead of him, and they went into a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025355"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not welcome him, because it was clear from his demeanor that he was determined to go to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025356"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When James and John, His disciples, saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them, just as Elijah did?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025357"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus turned and rebuked them, saying, "You do not understand the kind of spirit that is influencing you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025358"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Son of Man did not come to destroy people’s lives, but to save them. Then they went on to another village.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025359"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were traveling along the road, a man approached Him and said, "Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025360"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025361"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to another person, "Come, follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025362"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Let those who are spiritually dead take care of burying their own physically dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025363"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Another person also said, “Lord, I will follow you, but first let me go and say goodbye to my family at home.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025364"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "No one who puts their hand to the plow and then looks back is worthy of the kingdom of God."</span></p>
