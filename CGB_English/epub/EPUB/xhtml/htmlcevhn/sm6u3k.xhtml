<h3 class="index-book-title">Mark Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024590"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus left that place and went into the region of Judea, crossing to the east side of the Jordan River. Once again, crowds gathered around him, and as was his custom, he began teaching them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024591"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Pharisees approached Him and asked, "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife?" They were testing Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024592"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He responded and said to them, "What did Moses command you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024593"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024594"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Because of the stubbornness of your hearts, he gave you this command."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024595"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But from the very beginning of creation, God created them as male and female.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024596"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024597"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the two shall become one flesh. Therefore, they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024598"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, what God has united, no one should separate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024599"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And when they were in the house, his disciples questioned him again about the same subject.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024600"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024601"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024602"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">People brought young children to Jesus, asking him to place his hands on them and bless them. But his disciples scolded those who were bringing the children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024603"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw this, he was deeply displeased and said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024604"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I tell you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God with the humility and trust of a young child will never enter it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024605"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he gathered the children into his arms, placed his hands on them, and spoke a blessing over them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024606"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Jesus was setting out on his journey, a man came running up to him, knelt down before him, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024607"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024608"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware of the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not cheat others, and honor your father and mother.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024609"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he replied to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these commandments since I was young."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024610"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus looked at him with love and said, "There is one thing you still lack: go, sell everything you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, take up your cross, and follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024611"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Hearing this, he became deeply distressed and went away sorrowful, for he owned many possessions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024612"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024613"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus responded again, saying to them, "My children, how difficult it is for those who put their trust in wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024614"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024615"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they were utterly amazed, saying to one another, "Who then can be saved?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024616"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus looked at them and said, "For people, this is impossible, but not for God; with God, all things are possible."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024617"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter spoke up and said to him, "Look, we have left everything behind and have followed you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024618"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus responded, saying, "Truly, I tell you, there is no one who has left behind their home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or property, for my sake and for the sake of the gospel..."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024619"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he will receive a hundred times as much in this present age—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024620"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, many who are now considered foremost will end up being last, and those who are currently last will become first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024621"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, Jesus walked ahead of them. They were filled with awe, but as they followed, they also became afraid. Then Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and began to explain to them what was going to happen to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024622"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "Listen, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn Him to death and then hand Him over to the Gentiles."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024623"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will ridicule him, whip him, spit on him, and put him to death. But on the third day, he will rise again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024624"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him and said, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024625"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024626"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to him, "Allow us to sit, one at your right side and the other at your left, when you come into your glory."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024627"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus replied to them, "You do not understand what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or to undergo the baptism with which I am to be baptized?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024628"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to Him, “We are able.” Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you will undergo the baptism with which I am baptized.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024629"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The authority to grant positions at my right hand or my left is not mine to bestow; rather, these places will be given to those for whom they have been prepared.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024630"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became deeply upset with James and John.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024631"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their leaders wield authority over them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024632"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, this should not be the case among you. Instead, whoever desires to be great among you must become your servant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024633"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whoever among you desires to be the greatest must become the servant of all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024634"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024635"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They arrived at Jericho, and as Jesus was leaving the city with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside, begging.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024636"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024637"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many people sternly told him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024638"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus stopped and told them to call the man over. So they called out to the blind man, saying, “Take heart! Get up—he’s calling for you.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024639"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, throwing off his cloak, he got up and went to Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024640"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to him, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied, "Lord, I want to be able to see again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024641"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Go on your way; your faith has healed you." At once, his sight was restored, and he began to follow Jesus along the road.</span></p>
