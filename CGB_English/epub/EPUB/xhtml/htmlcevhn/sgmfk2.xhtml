<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The sources of the great deep were sealed, and the floodgates of the heavens were closed. The rain pouring down from the sky ceased.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The waters gradually receded from the earth, and after the 150 days had passed, the waters had diminished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of that month, on the mountains of Ararat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The floodwaters gradually receded until the tenth month. On the first day of that month, the peaks of the mountains became visible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After forty days had passed, Noah opened the window he had built in the ark.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the dove could find no place to rest the sole of her foot, so she returned to him in the ark, for the waters still covered the entire surface of the earth. Then Noah reached out his hand, took hold of her, and brought her back into the ark with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he waited another seven days; then he sent the dove out from the ark once more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000198"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was completely dry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000199"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And God spoke to Noah, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000200"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives with you."</span></p>

Nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100000206"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As long as the earth endures, the cycles of planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will never come to an end.</span></p>
