The Lord’s blessing rested on everything in his house and in his fields.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001156"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He entrusted everything he owned to Joseph’s care and did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001171"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the LORD was with Joseph, extended kindness to him, and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001172"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The prison warden entrusted Joseph with the responsibility of overseeing all the prisoners who were held in the prison.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001173"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The prison warden did not concern himself with anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and caused everything he did to succeed.</span></p>
