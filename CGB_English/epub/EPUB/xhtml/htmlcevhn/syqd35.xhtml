<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026122"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a man among the Pharisees named Nicodemus, who was a leader of the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026123"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This man came to Jesus at night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent from God, for no one can perform the miraculous signs you are doing unless God is with him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026124"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded and said to him, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless someone is born anew, they cannot perceive the kingdom of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026125"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nicodemus said to Him, "How can someone be born when they are already old? Can they enter their mother’s womb a second time and be born again?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026126"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026127"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What is born from human nature remains human in nature, but what is born from the Spirit is spiritual in essence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026128"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be surprised that I told you, "You must be born anew."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026129"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The wind blows wherever it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026130"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nicodemus responded and said to Him, "How can these things happen?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026131"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded and said to him, "Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026132"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen; yet you do not accept our testimony."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026133"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I have explained to you matters of this world, and you still do not believe, how will you believe if I speak to you about heavenly things?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026134"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">No one has ever ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026135"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Just as Moses raised up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be raised up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026136"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So that everyone who believes in him will not be destroyed but will have everlasting life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026137"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God loved the world so deeply that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him would not be lost but would have eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026138"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God did not send His Son into the world to pass judgment on the world, but so that the world might be rescued and restored through Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026139"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever believes in him is not judged, but whoever does not believe is already judged, because they have not trusted in the name of the one and only Son of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026140"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the basis for judgment: the light has come into the world, but people loved darkness more than light because their actions were evil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026141"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For everyone who does evil hates the light and refuses to come into the light, fearing that their actions will be exposed and condemned.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026142"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But whoever lives by the truth comes to the light, so that their actions may be clearly seen, for they are done in accordance with God’s will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026143"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, where he stayed with them and performed baptisms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026144"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John was also baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there. People came to him and were baptized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026145"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026146"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and certain Jews concerning the matter of ceremonial purification.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026147"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They went to John and said to him, "Teacher, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he is now baptizing, and everyone is going to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026148"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John replied, "A person cannot receive anything unless it is granted to them from heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026149"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.'</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026150"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands nearby and listens to him, is filled with great joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This is why my joy is now complete.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026151"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He must grow greater, but I must grow lesser.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026152"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who comes from above is supreme over all. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earthly realm and speaks from an earthly perspective. But the one who comes from heaven is supreme over all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026153"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What he has seen and heard, he declares as a witness; yet no one accepts his testimony.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026154"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever has accepted his testimony has affirmed that God is truthful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026155"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit to him without limit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026156"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything into his care.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026157"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever rejects the Son will not experience life—instead, the wrath of God remains upon them.</span></p>
