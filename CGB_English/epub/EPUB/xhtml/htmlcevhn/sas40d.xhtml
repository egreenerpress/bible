<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024540"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not experience death until they see the kingdom of God come in its full power."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024541"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him and led them up a high mountain by themselves, away from the others. There, in their presence, he was transformed in appearance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024542"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His clothing became radiant, intensely white, like no launderer on earth could ever bleach them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024543"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were speaking with Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024544"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter responded to Jesus, saying, "Teacher, it is wonderful for us to be here. Let us build three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024545"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For he did not know what to say, because they were utterly terrified.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024546"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A cloud descended and enveloped them, and from the cloud a voice spoke, saying, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024547"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one else anymore, except Jesus alone with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024548"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were descending the mountain, Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone about what they had witnessed until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024549"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They kept this statement to themselves, discussing among themselves what it could mean to rise from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024550"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They asked him, saying, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024551"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied to them, "Elijah truly comes first and restores all things. And as it is written concerning the Son of Man, he must endure many sufferings and be treated with contempt."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024552"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, just as it is written about him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024553"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he returned to his disciples, he saw a large crowd gathered around them, and the scribes were arguing with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024554"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, all the people, when they saw him, were utterly astonished. They ran to him and greeted him with great enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024555"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he asked the teachers of the law, "What are you arguing about with them?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024556"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then someone from the crowd spoke up and said, "Teacher, I have brought my son to you, for he is possessed by a spirit that makes him unable to speak."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024557"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Wherever the spirit seizes him, it throws him into convulsions. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they were unable to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024558"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He responded and said, "O unbelieving generation, how long must I remain with you? How long must I endure you? Bring him to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024559"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They brought the boy to Jesus, and as soon as he saw Him, the evil spirit violently convulsed the boy. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024560"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" His father replied, "Since he was a child."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024561"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many times it has thrown him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024562"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "If you are able to believe, everything is possible for the one who has faith."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024563"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately the father of the child cried out, and with tears said, “Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024564"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus noticed the crowd gathering quickly, he sternly addressed the unclean spirit, saying, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out of him and never enter him again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024565"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The unclean spirit cried out violently, convulsing the man severely, and then came out of him. The man was left as though he were dead, so much so that many who saw it said, "He is dead."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024566"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus grasped him by the hand and raised him up, and he stood on his feet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024567"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why were we unable to drive out the demon?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024568"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out except through prayer and fasting."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024569"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They left that place and traveled through Galilee, but Jesus did not want anyone to know about it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024570"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He instructed his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to the power of men, and they will put him to death. But after he has been killed, he will rise again on the third day."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024571"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they did not comprehend what he meant and were too afraid to ask him about it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024572"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus arrived in Capernaum and was in the house, he asked his disciples, "What were you arguing about among yourselves on the way here?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024573"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they remained silent, because on the way they had been arguing among themselves about who was the greatest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024574"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus sat down, called the twelve disciples to him, and said, "If anyone wants to be first, they must become last of all and a servant to everyone."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024575"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus took a child and placed him in the middle of the group. After picking the child up and holding him in his arms, he said to them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024576"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me is not merely welcoming me, but the one who sent me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024577"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John responded to Him, saying, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and he does not follow us. So we tried to stop him, because he is not one of our group."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024578"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who performs a miracle in my name will quickly turn around and speak evil of me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024579"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever is not opposing us is supporting us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024580"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024581"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be thrown into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024582"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life disabled than to have two hands and go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024583"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this place, their consuming decay never ceases, and the fire that consumes them is never extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024584"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have both feet and be thrown into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024585"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this place, their consuming destruction never ceases, and the fire that consumes them is never extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024586"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is far better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024587"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this place, their consuming decay never ceases, and the fire that consumes them is never extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024588"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For everyone will be purified by fire, and every offering will be seasoned with salt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024589"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Salt is valuable, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can you restore its flavor? Keep the essence of salt within yourselves, and live in peace with one another.</span></p>
