<h3 class="index-book-title">Luke Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025781"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now it happened that on one of those days, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders confronted him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025782"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They spoke to him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? And who is the one who gave you this authority?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025783"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied to them, "I will also ask you one question; answer me:"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025784"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The baptism performed by John—was it authorized by God, or was it merely a human institution?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025785"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They discussed the matter among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025786"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025787"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they replied that they were unable to determine its origin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025788"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025789"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus began to tell the people this parable: “A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and then went away to a distant country for a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025790"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At the appointed time, he sent a servant to the tenants of the vineyard, expecting them to give him a portion of the vineyard's produce. But the tenants seized the servant, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025791"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he sent another servant, but they beat him as well, treated him with disgrace, and sent him away with nothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025792"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he sent a third servant, but they also wounded him and threw him out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025793"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the owner of the vineyard said, “What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him when they see him.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025794"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the tenant farmers saw him, they discussed the matter among themselves, saying, “This is the heir. Let’s kill him so that the inheritance will become ours.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025795"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025796"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will come and put those tenants to death, then give the vineyard to others." When they heard this, they exclaimed, "May such a thing never happen!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025797"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He looked at them and said, "What then does this Scripture mean: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025798"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever falls on that stone will be shattered; but whoever it falls upon will be crushed to dust.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025799"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that very moment, the chief priests and the teachers of the law sought to seize him, but they were afraid of the crowd. They understood that he had told this parable against them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025800"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They kept a close watch on him and sent out spies who pretended to be sincere and upright men. Their goal was to catch him in his words so that they could hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025801"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach truthfully, and that You show no partiality to anyone, but teach the ways of God with complete integrity."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025802"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Is it permissible for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025803"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Jesus saw through their cunning and said to them, "Why are you trying to test me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025804"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Show me a coin. Whose image and inscription are on it?" They replied, "Caesar's."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025805"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025806"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were unable to trap him in his words in front of the people. They were astonished by his response and remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025807"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some Sadducees, who deny the reality of resurrection, came to him and posed a question.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025808"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the brother should marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025809"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There were seven brothers: the first one married a wife but died without having any children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025810"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the second brother married her, but he also died without having any children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025811"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the third brother married her, and in the same way, all seven brothers married her, one after the other. None of them had any children with her, and eventually, they all died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025812"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Finally, the woman also died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025813"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as their wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025814"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "The people of this present age marry and are given in marriage."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025815"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But those who are deemed worthy to attain that age to come and the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025816"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They will no longer be subject to death, for they will be like the angels and will be God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025817"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The fact that the dead are raised is demonstrated even by Moses in the account of the burning bush, where he refers to the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025818"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for in His presence all are alive.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025819"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some of the scribes responded, saying, "Teacher, you have spoken rightly."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025820"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After that, they no longer dared to ask him any more questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025821"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "How can people say that the Christ is David’s son?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025822"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David himself declares in the book of Psalms: "The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025823"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Until I make your enemies a place for your feet to rest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025824"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">David therefore calls him 'Lord,' so how can he be his son?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025825"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, in the presence of all the people, he said to his disciples,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025826"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Be on guard against the scribes, who seek to walk around in long, flowing robes, who delight in being greeted with respect in the marketplaces, who desire the most prominent seats in the synagogues, and who covet the places of honor at banquets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025827"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These are the ones who exploit widows by taking over their homes, and then make a show of offering lengthy prayers to appear righteous. Such people will face a more severe judgment.</span></p>
