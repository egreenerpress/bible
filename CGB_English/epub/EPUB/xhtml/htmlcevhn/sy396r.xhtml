<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026827"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026828"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on his head. They then dressed him in a purple robe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026829"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and then they struck him with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026830"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate then went out to them again and said, "Look, I am bringing him out to you so that you may see I find no basis for any charge against him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026831"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Look at the man!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026832"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" Pilate said to them, "Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no basis for a charge against Him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026833"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders responded to him, "We have a law, and according to our law, he deserves to die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026834"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Pilate heard this statement, he became even more fearful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026835"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he went back into the judgment hall and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus did not give him an answer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026836"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Pilate said to him, "Are you not speaking to me? Do you not realize that I have the authority to crucify you, and I also have the authority to release you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026837"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied, "You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed me over to you bears the greater guilt."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026838"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From that moment, Pilate sought to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, saying, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026839"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Pilate heard this statement, he brought Jesus out and took his seat on the judgment platform at a place called the Pavement, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026840"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It was the day of preparation for the Passover, around noon, when he said to the Jewish leaders, "Look, here is your King!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026841"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Should I crucify your king?" The chief priests replied, "We have no king except Caesar."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026842"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026843"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Carrying his own cross, he went out to a place known as the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026844"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There they crucified him, along with two others—one on each side—and Jesus in the middle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026845"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate had a notice written and placed on the cross. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026846"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The notice was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026847"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘He claimed to be the King of the Jews.’”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026848"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Pilate replied, "What I have written remains as it is."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026849"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothing and divided it into four parts, giving each soldier a share. They also took his tunic, which was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026850"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but instead let's cast lots to decide who will get it." This was done to fulfill the Scripture that says, "They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots." And so the soldiers did these things.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026851"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, along with his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026852"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus saw his mother standing there, along with the disciple he loved, he said to her, "Dear woman, here is your son."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026853"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother!" And from that moment on, the disciple took her into his own home.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026854"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After this, Jesus, aware that everything had now been completed and that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026855"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There was a container filled with sour wine nearby. They soaked a sponge in the wine, placed it on a hyssop branch, and lifted it to his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026856"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, "It is accomplished." Then he bowed his head and surrendered his spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026857"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Jewish leaders, because it was the day of preparation and they did not want the bodies to remain on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a particularly significant day), asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and their bodies taken down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026858"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026859"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026860"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But one of the soldiers thrust a spear into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026861"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who witnessed these events has testified to them, and his testimony is trustworthy. He knows that he speaks the truth, so that you may also believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026862"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">These events took place so that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026863"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And again, another scripture says, "They will look upon the one they have pierced."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026864"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but kept it secret out of fear of the Jewish authorities, asked Pilate for permission to take away the body of Jesus. Pilate granted his request. So Joseph came and took the body of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026865"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also arrived. He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026866"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026867"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the place where He was crucified, there was a garden, and in that garden was a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026868"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they placed Jesus there because it was the day of preparation for the Jews, and the tomb was nearby.</span></p>
