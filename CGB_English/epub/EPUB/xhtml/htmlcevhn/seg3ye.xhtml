<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025461"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, a vast crowd of people had gathered, so many that they were stepping on one another. He first began to speak to his disciples, saying, "Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025462"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For there is nothing concealed that will not be brought to light, nor anything hidden that will not be made known.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025463"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, whatever you have said in secret will be heard openly, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed publicly for all to hear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025464"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who can kill the body but afterward have no power to do anything more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025465"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I will warn you about whom you should truly fear: Fear the one who, after taking a life, has the authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025466"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025467"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But even the hairs on your head are all counted. So do not be afraid; you are worth far more than many sparrows.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025468"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I also tell you this: Whoever acknowledges me openly before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025469"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But whoever denies me in the presence of others will be denied in the presence of God’s angels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025470"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025471"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they bring you before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025472"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the Holy Spirit will instruct you at that very moment what you should say.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025473"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of the people in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025474"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "Friend, who appointed me to be your judge or arbitrator?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025475"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Be careful and guard yourselves against greed, for a person's life does not depend on the abundance of their possessions."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025476"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He told them a parable, saying, "The land of a certain wealthy man produced an abundant harvest."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025477"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he began to think to himself, saying, “What should I do, since I have no place to store my crops?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025478"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said, "This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and goods."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025479"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And I will say to myself, "Self, you have stored up plenty of goods for many years to come. Relax, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025480"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will own all the things you have prepared for yourself?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025481"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, a person who stores up wealth for themselves but does not grow rich in their relationship with God is like this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025482"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to his disciples, "For this reason, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, worrying about what you will eat, nor about your body, concerned with what you will wear."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025483"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Life is more than just food, and the body is more than just clothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025484"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Consider the ravens: they do not plant seeds or harvest crops; they have no storerooms or barns, yet God provides for them. How much more valuable are you than the birds?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025485"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Which of you, by worrying, can add even a single hour to your life?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025486"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you are unable to accomplish even the simplest task, why are you anxious about the rest?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025487"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Observe the lilies and how they grow: they do not labor or spin thread; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendor was not clothed as magnificently as one of these.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025488"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If God so beautifully clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will He clothe you, you who have so little faith?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025489"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be preoccupied with what you will eat or what you will drink, nor let your heart be troubled with anxious thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025490"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The nations of the world strive after all these things, but your Father knows that you need them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025491"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Instead, make it your priority to pursue God's kingdom, and all these things will be provided for you as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025492"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be afraid, small flock, for it is your Father’s delight to give you the kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025493"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Sell your possessions and give to those in need. Make for yourselves purses that do not wear out—a lasting treasure in heaven, where no thief can steal and no moth can destroy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025494"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For where your treasure is stored, there your heart and deepest devotion will also reside.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025495"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Be prepared and ready for action, with your robes tucked into your belt, and keep your lamps burning brightly."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025496"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Be like people who are waiting for their master to return from a wedding celebration, so that when he arrives and knocks, they can open the door for him right away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025497"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Blessed are those servants whom the master, upon his return, finds alert and ready.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025498"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if he arrives during the second watch or even the third watch and finds them alert and ready, those servants will be truly blessed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025499"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Understand this: if the owner of the house had known at what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025500"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, you must also be prepared, for the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025501"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us, or for everyone?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025502"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Lord said, "Who then is that trustworthy and prudent manager, whom his master will appoint to oversee his household, to distribute to them their allotted portion of food at the proper time?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025503"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Fortunate is that servant whom his master, upon returning, finds faithfully carrying out his duties.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025504"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025505"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, if that servant says to himself, "My master is delaying his return," and then begins to mistreat the male and female servants, indulging in eating, drinking, and getting drunk,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025506"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not prepared for.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025507"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And that servant who knew his master’s will but did not prepare himself or act according to it will be severely punished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025508"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But the one who acted without knowledge and did things deserving punishment will receive a lighter beating. For to whom much has been given, much will be expected; and from the one entrusted with much, even more will be demanded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025509"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have come to bring fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already ablaze!</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025514"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus also said to the crowd, "When you see a cloud forming in the west, you immediately say, 'A rainstorm is coming,' and it happens just as you predict.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025515"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you see the south wind blowing, you say, "It will be hot," and it happens just as you said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025517"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why do you not, on your own, discern what is just and right?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100025518"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you are on your way with your adversary to appear before the magistrate, make every effort to settle the matter with them along the way.
