<h3 class="index-book-title">Mark Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024502"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In those days, when a large crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024503"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I feel deep concern for the crowd, because they have stayed with me for three days now and have nothing to eat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024504"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if I send them away to their homes without food, they will collapse on the way, for many of them have come from a great distance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024505"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And His disciples replied to Him, "How can anyone provide enough bread to feed all these people here in this desolate place?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024506"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024507"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. He took the seven loaves of bread, gave thanks to God, broke the loaves into pieces, and handed them to his disciples to distribute to the people. The disciples did as he directed and placed the bread before the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024508"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They also had a few small fish. He gave thanks for them and instructed that they too be served to the people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024509"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they ate and were fully satisfied. Afterward, they gathered up the leftover pieces of bread and filled seven baskets with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024510"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The number of those who had eaten was approximately four thousand. Afterward, Jesus dismissed them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024511"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Immediately, He boarded a boat with His disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024512"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Pharisees came forward and began to question Him, asking for a sign from heaven to test Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024513"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he groaned deeply within his spirit and said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024514"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left them, boarded the boat again, and set off for the other side.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024515"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disciples had forgotten to bring bread with them, and they had only one loaf in the boat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024516"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus warned them, saying, "Be careful and stay alert; guard yourselves against the influence of the Pharisees and the ways of Herod."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024517"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they began discussing among themselves, saying, "This is because we did not bring any bread."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024518"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus became aware of their thoughts, he said to them, "Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts still hardened?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024519"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you have eyes, yet fail to see? Do you have ears, yet fail to hear? And do you not recall?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024520"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I broke the five loaves to feed the five thousand, how many baskets full of leftover pieces did you gather? They replied to him, "Twelve."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024521"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When I fed the four thousand with seven loaves, how many baskets full of leftover pieces did you collect? They replied, "Seven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024522"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He said to them, "Why do you not comprehend?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024523"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came to Bethsaida, and they brought a blind man to him, pleading with him to touch the man.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024524"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. After spitting on his eyes and placing his hands on him, he asked, "Do you see anything?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024525"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees walking around."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024526"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After that, he placed his hands once more on the man’s eyes and had him look up. Then his sight was fully restored, and he could see everything clearly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024527"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And He sent him to his home, instructing him, "Do not go into the village, and do not tell anyone in the village about this."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024528"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. As they traveled, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024529"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say one of the prophets."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024530"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024531"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he instructed them not to tell anyone about him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024532"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He began to teach them that the Son of Man must endure great suffering, be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, but after three days, he would rise again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024533"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus spoke these words plainly. Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024534"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when He turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024535"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus gathered the crowd along with his disciples and said to them, "If anyone desires to follow me, they must deny their own self-interest, take up their cross, and commit to following me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024536"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For whoever seeks to preserve their own life will ultimately lose it; but whoever is willing to give up their life for my sake and for the sake of the gospel will truly save it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024537"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What benefit will a person have if they acquire the entire world but forfeit their own soul?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024538"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What can a person offer in return for their own life?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024539"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, whoever is ashamed of me and my teachings in this unfaithful and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of them when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span></p>
