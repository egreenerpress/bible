<h3 class="index-book-title">Acts Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027857"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a man named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027858"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We boarded a ship from Adramyttium and set sail, intending to travel along the coast of Asia. With us was Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027859"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The following day, we arrived at Sidon. Julius, treating Paul with kindness, allowed him the freedom to visit his friends and receive care and refreshment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027860"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After we set sail from there, we traveled along the southern coast of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027861"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After we had sailed across the sea near Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra, a city in Lycia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027862"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There, the centurion found a ship from Alexandria bound for Italy, and he placed us on board.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027863"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After we had sailed slowly for many days and had barely reached the area near Cnidus, the wind prevented us from going further. So we sailed along the sheltered side of Crete, passing by Cape Salmone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027864"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After narrowly passing it, we arrived at a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027865"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After a considerable amount of time had passed and sailing had become hazardous because the Day of Atonement had already gone by, Paul warned them,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027866"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Gentlemen, I can see that this journey will result in injury and significant loss—not only to the cargo and the ship but also to our lives."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027867"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the centurion trusted the ship’s captain and the owner more than he did the words spoken by Paul.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027868"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter, the majority decided to leave from there as well, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor in Crete that faces both southwest and northwest, and to spend the winter there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027869"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the south wind began to blow gently, they thought they had achieved their goal. So they set sail from there and sailed close along the coast of Crete.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027870"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Not long afterward, a violent windstorm, known as Euroclydon, swept in against them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027871"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the ship was seized by the storm and could no longer hold its course against the wind, we allowed it to be driven along by the force of the gale.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027872"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As we sailed past a small island called Clauda, we struggled greatly to secure the lifeboat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027873"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had hoisted the lifeboat aboard, they used ropes to reinforce the ship. Fearing that they might run aground on the sandbars, they lowered the sails and let the ship be driven along by the wind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027874"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And as we were violently battered by the storm, the next day they began to throw the ship’s cargo overboard to lighten it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027875"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the third day, we threw overboard with our own hands the ship's equipment and gear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027876"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When neither the sun nor the stars appeared for many days, and a severe storm continued to rage upon us, all hope of our being saved was finally lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027877"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After a long period without food, Paul stood up among them and said, "Gentlemen, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete. Then you would have avoided this harm and loss."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027878"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now I encourage you to take heart, for not one of you will lose your life—only the ship will be lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027879"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this very night, the angel of God stood beside me—the God to whom I belong and whom I serve.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027880"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And look, God has granted you the safety of all those sailing with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027881"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, gentlemen, take heart and be encouraged, for I trust in God that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027882"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Nevertheless, we will be driven ashore onto some island.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027883"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the fourteenth night, as we were being tossed about in the Adriatic Sea, around midnight the sailors sensed that we were approaching land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They measured the depth and found it to be twenty fathoms. After moving a short distance farther, they measured again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then, fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and anxiously waited for daylight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the sailors were preparing to abandon the ship, they lowered the lifeboat into the sea, pretending they were going to drop anchors from the bow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it drift away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027889"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As dawn approached, Paul urged everyone to eat something, saying, "Today marks the fourteenth day that you have waited and gone without food, having eaten nothing."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, I urge you to eat some food, for this is necessary for your well-being. Not a single hair from any of your heads will be lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of everyone, he broke it and began to eat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they all became encouraged and took some food.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And there were a total of 276 people on board the ship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had eaten their fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach. They decided, if possible, to run the ship aground there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had pulled up the anchors, they entrusted themselves to the sea, released the ropes that secured the rudders, raised the mainsail to catch the wind, and headed toward the shore.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027897"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ship drifted into a place where two currents met, and they ran it aground. The front of the ship became stuck and remained immovable, while the back of the ship was shattered by the force of the waves.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The soldiers proposed to kill the prisoners, fearing that some might swim away and escape.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027899"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the centurion, wanting to spare Paul’s life, prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make their way to land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100027900"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The remaining survivors reached safety in various ways—some clinging to planks and others to fragments of the ship. In this manner, they all made it safely to shore.</span></p>
