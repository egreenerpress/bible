<h3 class="index-book-title">II Corinthians Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028934"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Furthermore, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace of God that has been given to the churches in Macedonia.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028935"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the midst of severe suffering and hardship, their overflowing joy and extreme poverty have resulted in an extraordinary generosity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028936"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I can testify that they gave according to their means, and even beyond their means. They did so willingly and on their own initiative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028937"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They earnestly pleaded with us, urging that we accept the gift and join in the shared effort of supporting the needs of the believers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028938"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did this not merely as we had expected, but they first gave themselves completely to the Lord, and then to us, in accordance with God’s will.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028939"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We earnestly urged Titus that, just as he had started this work among you, he should also complete this act of grace for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028940"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, since you excel in every way—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in the love you have shown us—make sure that you also excel in this act of grace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028941"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am not speaking as though I am giving you a command, but rather taking advantage of the eagerness shown by others to test the genuineness of your love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028942"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You are aware of the gracious act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028943"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Here is my advice, which I offer for your benefit: It is appropriate for you, who not only started this work last year but were also eager to do so, to continue now.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028944"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now then, carry out the act of giving as you have intended, so that just as there was eagerness in your willingness, there may also be completion according to what you have.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028945"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If someone is genuinely willing to give, their gift is valued based on what they have, not on what they do not have.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028946"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I do not intend that others should have relief while you are burdened.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028947"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Rather, the goal is fairness: that at this present time, your surplus may meet their need, so that in turn their surplus may one day meet your need. In this way, there can be balance and equality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028948"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is written, "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028949"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But we give thanks to God, who has placed the same deep concern for you in the heart of Titus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028950"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Indeed, he welcomed the encouragement, but being even more eager, he willingly went to you on his own initiative.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028951"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We have also sent with him a fellow believer who is highly esteemed for his work in spreading the gospel among all the churches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028952"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Not only that, but he was also chosen by the churches to accompany us in this act of grace, which we are administering for the glory of the Lord and as a demonstration of your eager willingness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028953"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To prevent this, we are taking care that no one can criticize us regarding the generous offering we are managing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028954"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Acting with integrity and doing what is right, not only as seen by the Lord but also as observed by others.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028955"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often found to be diligent in many matters, and now even more so because of the great confidence I have in you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028956"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker in serving you. And if our brothers are inquired about, they are representatives of the churches and bring honor to Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028957"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, demonstrate to them, and in the presence of the churches, the evidence of your love and the justification for our pride in you.</span></p>
