<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026158"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard about Jesus making and baptizing more disciples than John,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026159"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Although Jesus himself did not perform baptisms, it was his disciples who carried out this practice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026160"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left Judea and went back to Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026161"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026162"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he came to a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026163"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now, Jacob’s well was located there. Jesus, weary from his journey, sat down by the well just as he was. It was about noon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026164"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026165"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">(For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026166"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026167"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to her, saying, "If you truly understood the gift of God and who it is that is asking you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him instead, and he would have given you living water."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026168"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where, then, do you get this living water?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026169"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and his livestock?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026170"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus replied to her, "Anyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026171"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But whoever drinks the water that I will give them will never thirst again; for the water I give will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026172"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman said to him, "Sir, please give me this water, so that I will never be thirsty again and won’t have to keep coming here to draw water."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026173"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come back here."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026174"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman replied, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You are correct in saying, 'I have no husband.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026175"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have had five husbands, and the man you are with now is not your husband. What you have said is true.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026176"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman said to him, "Sir, I can see that you are a prophet."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026177"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You worship something you do not fully understand; we worship what we know, because salvation comes from the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The time is coming, and indeed is already here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father is seeking such people to worship Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "I am the one speaking to you—I am he."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that moment, His disciples returned and were astonished to find Him speaking with the woman. Yet none of them dared to ask, “What do You want?” or, “Why are You talking with her?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The woman then left her water jar behind and went into the city, where she said to the people,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done. Could this be the Messiah?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they left the city and came to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Meanwhile, His disciples urged Him, saying, "Teacher, please eat something."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026190"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So the disciples began saying to one another, "Has anyone brought him something to eat?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026191"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "My nourishment and purpose come from doing the will of the One who sent me and completing the work He has given me to accomplish."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026192"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not say, “There are still four months until the harvest comes”? Listen, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already ripe and ready for harvest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026193"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who reaps receives wages and gathers a harvest for eternal life, so that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026194"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In this situation, the saying holds true: one person plants the seed, and another gathers the harvest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026195"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I sent you to harvest where you have not worked; others have done the labor, and you have entered into the fruit of their efforts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026196"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the testimony of the woman, who declared, "He told me everything I ever did."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026197"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he remained there for two days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026198"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And many more came to believe because of his own message.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026199"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not just because of what you told us, but because we have heard Him for ourselves. We are certain that this is truly the Messiah, the Savior of the world."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026200"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Two days later, he left that place and traveled to Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026201"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For Jesus himself declared that a prophet is not honored in his own hometown.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026202"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had witnessed all the things he had done in Jerusalem during the festival. They, too, had attended the feast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026203"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Jesus returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned water into wine. There was a certain royal official whose son was ill in Capernaum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026204"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him and pleaded with him to come down and heal his son, for the boy was near death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026205"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you see miraculous signs and wonders, you will not believe."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026206"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The nobleman said to him, "Sir, please come down before my child dies."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026207"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Go on your way; your son will live." The man believed the words that Jesus had spoken to him, and he set off on his journey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026208"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As he was on his way back, his servants came to meet him and informed him, saying, "Your son is alive."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026209"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he asked them about the time when the man began to recover. They replied, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026210"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So the father realized that it was at the very hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." And he believed, along with his entire household.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026211"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed after he had come from Judea to Galilee.</span></p>
