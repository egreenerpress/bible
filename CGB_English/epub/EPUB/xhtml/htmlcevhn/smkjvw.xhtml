<h3 class="index-book-title">Genesis Chapter 37</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001085"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob settled in the land where his father had lived as a foreigner, in the land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001086"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the account of Jacob’s descendants. Joseph, at seventeen years old, was tending the flock alongside his brothers. He was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives, and Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001087"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other children because Joseph was born to him in his old age. So Israel had a special robe made for Joseph, a richly ornamented garment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than all of them, they grew to hate him and could no longer speak to him in a friendly or peaceful manner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001089"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001090"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "Please listen to this dream I have had:"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001091"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen, we were out in the field tying up bundles of grain, and suddenly my bundle stood upright and remained standing. Then, your bundles gathered around and bowed down to mine.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001092"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His brothers said to him, "Do you really think you will rule over us? Will you truly have authority over us?" And they hated him even more because of his dreams and his words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001093"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He had yet another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “Listen, I have had another dream. In it, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001094"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He told his father and his brothers about it, and his father scolded him, saying, "What is this dream you have had? Will I, your mother, and your brothers really come and bow down to you, prostrating ourselves before you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001095"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001096"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And his brothers went to tend their father’s flock in Shechem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001097"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Israel said to Joseph, "Aren’t your brothers tending the flocks in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." Joseph replied, "I am ready."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001098"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to him, "Please go and check on the welfare of your brothers and the flocks, and bring me back a report." So he sent him out from the valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001099"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A man came upon him and saw that he was wandering aimlessly in the field. The man approached him and asked, "What are you looking for?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001100"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me, where are they tending their flocks?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001101"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The man replied, "They have moved on from here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001102"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they saw him from a distance, even before he came close to them, they plotted together to kill him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001103"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said to one another, "Look, here comes this dreamer!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001104"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of these pits. We can say that a wild animal has devoured him. Then we will see what becomes of his dreams."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001105"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Reuben heard this, he intervened to rescue him from their hands, saying, "We must not take his life."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001106"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Reuben said to them, "Do not shed his blood. Instead, throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not harm him." He said this intending to rescue Joseph from their hands and return him safely to their father.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001107"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Joseph arrived to meet his brothers, they seized him and stripped off his robe—the richly ornamented robe he was wearing—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001108"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They seized him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty, with no water in it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001109"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They sat down to eat a meal, but as they looked up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm, and myrrh, which they were transporting down to Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001110"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Judah said to his brothers, "What good will it come to if we kill our brother and hide his bloodshed?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001111"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let us not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed to this plan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001112"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some Midianite traders passed by, and they pulled Joseph up out of the pit and lifted him out. They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and the Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001113"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Reuben went back to the pit, but when he looked, Joseph was no longer there. Overcome with distress, he tore his clothes in anguish.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001114"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone. What will I do now? Where can I go?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001115"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001116"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They sent the multicolored robe and brought it to their father, saying, "We found this. Please examine it and see if it is your son's robe or not."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001117"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He recognized it and said, "This is my son’s robe! A wild animal has torn him apart! Joseph has surely been devoured!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001118"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jacob tore his garments, put on sackcloth around his waist, and mourned deeply for his son for many days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001119"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All of his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to accept their comfort. He said, "I will go down to the grave mourning for my son." And so, his father continued to weep for him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100001120"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard.</span></p>
