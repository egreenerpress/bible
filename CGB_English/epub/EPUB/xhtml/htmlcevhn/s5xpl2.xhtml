She saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance of the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026870"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have placed him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026871"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026872"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So they both ran together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026873"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He bent down and peered inside, seeing the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026874"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and entered the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026875"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the cloth that had been wrapped around his head was not lying with the linen wrappings but was folded up and set apart in a separate place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026876"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the other disciple, who had arrived at the tomb first, also went inside. He saw the evidence and came to believe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026877"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, they did not yet understand the Scripture, which foretold that he must rise from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026878"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the disciples returned once more to their own homes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026879"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Mary remained outside the tomb, weeping. As she wept, she bent down and peered into the tomb.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026880"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And she saw two angels dressed in white, one sitting at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026881"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She replied, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have placed him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026882"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After she had spoken these words, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize that it was Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026883"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" She, thinking he was the gardener, replied, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned around and said to him, "Rabboni," which means "Teacher."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to her, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Mary Magdalene went and informed the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things to her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On that same day, the first day of the week, in the evening, the disciples had gathered together behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities. Suddenly, Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them, "Peace be with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026889"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them once more, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After saying this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they remain unforgiven.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was also called Didymus, was not with the other disciples when Jesus appeared to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the place where the nails were, and place my hand into his side, I will not believe.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Eight days later, the disciples were gathered together again, and this time Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them, saying, "Peace be with you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and place it in my side. Do not doubt any longer, but believe."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Thomas responded to Him, saying, "You are my Lord and my God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026897"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026898"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</span></p>
