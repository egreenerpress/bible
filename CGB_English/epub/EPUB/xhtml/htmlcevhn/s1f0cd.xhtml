<h3 class="index-book-title">John Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026900"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After these events, Jesus appeared once more to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and this is how he revealed himself to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026901"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter was there, along with Thomas, also known as Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026902"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter said to them, "I am going out to fish." They replied, "We will go with you." So they went out and got into the boat right away, but that night they caught nothing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026903"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When morning arrived, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026904"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus said to them, "Friends, do you have any food?" They replied, "No."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026905"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast it, and now they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026906"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the sea.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026907"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The other disciples came in a small boat (for they were not far from shore, about two hundred cubits away), pulling the net full of fish.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026908"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as they reached the shore, they noticed a charcoal fire burning, with fish placed on it and some bread nearby.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026909"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026910"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Simon Peter went up and pulled the net to shore, filled with large fish, one hundred and fifty-three in total. Even though there were so many, the net did not tear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026911"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to them, "Come and eat." But none of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" because they knew it was the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026912"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus then came, took the bread, and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026913"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026914"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these others do?” Peter replied, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Take care of my lambs.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026915"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus asked him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Simon replied, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Take care of my sheep."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026916"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus asked him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was deeply hurt because Jesus had asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He replied, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Take care of my sheep.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026917"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wished. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and lead you where you do not want to go."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026918"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would bring glory to God. After saying this, he told him, "Follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026919"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them—the same one who had leaned close to Jesus during the meal and asked, "Lord, who is the one who will betray you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026920"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter, noticing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man? What will happen to him?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026921"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he remain until I return, what concern is that of yours? You must follow me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026922"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This saying then spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus had not said to him that he would not die, but rather, "If I desire that he remain until I return, what concern is that to you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026923"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the disciple who bears witness to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100026924"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There are also many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written down, I imagine that even the whole world would not have enough space for the books that would be written. Amen.</span></p>
