<h3 class="index-book-title">Jonah Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022560"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022561"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Get up and go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message I give you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022562"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh, as the LORD had commanded. Now Nineveh was an exceptionally large city, requiring three days to walk through it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022563"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jonah started to go into the city, traveling a day’s distance, and he proclaimed, saying, “In forty days, Nineveh will be destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022564"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The people of Nineveh believed in God’s message, and they declared a time of fasting. Everyone, from the most prominent to the least significant among them, dressed in sackcloth as a sign of their repentance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022565"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his royal robe, clothed himself in sackcloth, and sat down in ashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022566"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he issued a decree, with the authority of the king and his nobles, to be proclaimed and announced throughout Nineveh, saying: "No person or animal, whether from the herds or flocks, is to eat anything. They must not graze or drink water."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022567"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Let both people and animals be clothed in sackcloth, and let them cry out earnestly to God. Furthermore, let every person turn away from their wicked ways and from the acts of violence they have committed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022568"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who can say whether God might relent and change His mind, turning away from His intense anger so that we may not be destroyed?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100022569"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">God observed their actions and saw that they had turned away from their wicked ways. As a result, God relented from the disaster He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not carry it out.</span></p>
