<h3 class="index-book-title">I John Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030626"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born of God; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one who is born of Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030627"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is how we know that we truly love God's children: when we love God and obey his commands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030628"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is what it means to love God: that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030629"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For everyone who is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world—our faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030630"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who is it that conquers the world, if not the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030631"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the one who came through water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies to this, because the Spirit is truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030632"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For there are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are united as one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030633"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">There are three that testify on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are in agreement as one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030634"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If we accept the testimony of people, the testimony of God is far greater, for this is the testimony that God has given about His Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030635"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony within themselves. But whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030636"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in His Son.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030637"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever has the Son has life; but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030638"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know with certainty that you possess eternal life, and so that you may continue to place your faith in the name of the Son of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030639"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This is the assurance we have in Him: that if we ask anything in alignment with His will, He listens to us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030640"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if we are confident that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we can be assured that we have received what we requested from him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030641"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If anyone sees a fellow believer committing a sin that does not lead to death, they should pray, and God will grant life to the one who has sinned—provided it is not a sin leading to death. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying that one should pray about that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030642"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All wrongdoing is sin, but there is a sin that does not lead to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030643"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We understand that whoever is born of God does not continue in a life of sin; rather, the one who is born of God guards himself, and the evil one cannot harm him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030644"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We understand that we belong to God, and the entire world is under the power of evil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030645"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We know that the Son of God has come and has given us the ability to understand, so that we may know the one who is true. We are united with him who is true—through his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the source of eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030646"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Dear children, guard yourselves against idols. Amen.</span></p>
