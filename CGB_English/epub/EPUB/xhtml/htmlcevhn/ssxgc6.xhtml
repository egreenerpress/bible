<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024756"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Two days later, the Passover festival and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were about to begin. The chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and have him put to death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024757"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But they replied, "Not during the festival, or there might be a riot among the people."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024758"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar containing very expensive perfume made of pure spikenard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume over his head.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024759"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Some among them were inwardly upset and said, "Why was this ointment wasted in such a way?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024760"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor." And they began to criticize her harshly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024761"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said, "Leave her alone; why are you causing her trouble? She has done a beautiful thing for me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024762"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You will always have the poor among you, and whenever you wish, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024763"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She has done what she could; she has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024764"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed throughout the entire world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024765"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests to arrange how he might betray Jesus to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024766"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When they heard this, they were pleased and agreed to give him money. Then he began looking for an opportune moment to betray him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024767"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, His disciples asked Him, "Where do You want us to go and make preparations so You can eat the Passover meal?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024768"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He sent out two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a water jar will meet you. Follow him."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024769"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, "Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024770"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he will show you a large upper room, fully furnished and ready. Prepare everything there for us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024771"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His disciples went out and entered the city, where they found everything just as he had told them. Then they prepared the Passover meal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024772"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the evening, he arrived with the twelve.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024773"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were sitting and eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you who is sharing this meal with me will betray me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024774"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they became deeply distressed and began to ask Him one after another, "Surely it isn’t me, is it?" And another said, "Could it be me?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024775"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he responded to them, saying, "It is one of the twelve—the one who dips bread with me in the bowl."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024776"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Son of Man will indeed go, just as it has been written about him. But how terrible it will be for that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024777"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024778"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He took the cup, and after giving thanks, he handed it to them, and they all drank from it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024779"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024780"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly, I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024781"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024782"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to them, "All of you will fall away because of me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024783"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024784"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else falls away, I will not."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024785"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very day, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024786"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he insisted even more strongly, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you in any way." And all the others said the same.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024787"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They arrived at a place called Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, "Stay here and wait while I go over there to pray."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024788"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then He took Peter, James, and John with Him and began to be deeply distressed and overwhelmed with sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024789"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024790"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He went a short distance farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, this hour might be taken away from him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024791"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said, "Father, my Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup of suffering from me. Yet not what I desire, but what you will."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024792"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not stay awake for one hour?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024793"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Stay alert and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024794"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Once more, he went away and prayed, repeating the same words.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024795"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he returned, he found them asleep once more, for their eyes were heavy with weariness, and they did not know how to respond to him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024796"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He came back a third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The time has come. Look, the Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of sinners."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024797"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Get up, let us go; look, the one who is betraying me is approaching."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024798"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And at that very moment, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived. With him came a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024799"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The one who betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, "The man I kiss is the one; arrest him and take him away securely."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024800"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As soon as he arrived, he went directly to him and said, "Teacher, Teacher!" and then kissed him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024801"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They placed their hands on him and seized him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024802"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">47 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One of those standing nearby drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024803"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">48 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as though I were a criminal?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024804"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">49 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was with you every day in the temple, teaching, and you did not seize me. But this has happened so that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024805"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">50 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they all abandoned him and ran away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024806"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">51 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth wrapped around his body. When the men tried to seize him, he slipped out of the linen cloth and ran away naked.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024807"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">52 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He left the linen garment behind and fled from them, completely unclothed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024808"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">53 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes gathered together with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024809"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">54 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Peter followed Jesus at a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. He sat down among the servants and warmed himself by the fire.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024810"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">55 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The high priests and the entire council sought testimony against Jesus in order to condemn him to death, but they could find none.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024811"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">56 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Many people came forward to give false testimony against him, but their statements did not agree with one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024812"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">57 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some individuals came forward and brought false accusations against him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024813"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">58 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">We heard him say, "I will destroy this temple built by human hands, and in three days I will raise up another, not made by human hands."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024814"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">59 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, even then their testimonies did not align with one another.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024815"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">60 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The high priest stood up among them and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do you have no response? What do you say about the testimony these witnesses are bringing against you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024816"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">61 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he remained silent and gave no answer. Once more the high priest questioned him, saying, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024817"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">62 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And Jesus replied, "I am He. And you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of divine power and coming with the clouds of heaven."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024818"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">63 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "Why do we need any more witnesses?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024819"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">64 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You have heard this blasphemy. What is your judgment? And they all declared him guilty, deserving death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024820"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">65 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then some began to spit on him, and they covered his face. They struck him with their fists and mocked him, saying, "Prophesy!" And the guards slapped him with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024821"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">66 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Peter was downstairs in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s servant girls came over.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024822"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">67 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she noticed Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Nazareth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024823"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">68 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he denied it, saying, "I do not know or understand what you are talking about." Then he went out to the porch, and the rooster crowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024824"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">69 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A servant girl noticed him again and started saying to those standing nearby, "This man is one of them."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024825"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">70 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he denied it once more. Shortly after, those standing nearby said to Peter again, "You must be one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your way of speaking gives you away."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024826"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">71 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he began to curse vehemently and to swear, saying, "I do not know this man you are talking about."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024827"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">72 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." As he reflected on this, he broke down and wept.</span></p>
