<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023462"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Now when John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent two of his disciples to Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023463"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they asked him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023466"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And fortunate is the one who does not take offense at me or stumble because of me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023467"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?</span></p>

A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear luxurious clothing are found in royal palaces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023469"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023470"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is the one about whom it is written: "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare the way before you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023471"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Truly I tell you, among those born of women, no one greater than John the Baptist has ever arisen. Yet even the least significant person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023472"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and determined people are seizing it with urgency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023473"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the prophets and the Law foretold events up until the time of John.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023474"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And if you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah, the one who was destined to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023475"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Whoever has the ability to understand, let them pay close attention and truly comprehend.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023476"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To what shall I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling out to their friends,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023477"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And they said, "We played joyful music for you, but you did not dance; we sang mournful songs, but you did not grieve."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023478"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">John came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and people said, "He has a demon."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023479"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Look at this man! He is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is proven right by the actions of those who follow it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023480"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities where most of his powerful deeds had been performed, because they had not turned from their ways in repentance.</span></p>

How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful miracles performed among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, showing their sorrow by wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023482"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023483"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And you, Capernaum, who have been lifted up to the heights, will be brought down to the depths. For if the powerful deeds performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained standing to this day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023484"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023485"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, Jesus responded and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and have revealed them to the humble and childlike."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023486"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Yes, Father, for this was pleasing and fitting in your sight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023487"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023490"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the yoke I offer is gentle, and the load I give is light.</span></p>
