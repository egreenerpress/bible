<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020884"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And say, "What is your mother? She is a lioness. She reclined among lions; she raised her cubs among young lions."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020885"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She raised one of her cubs, and it grew into a strong young lion. It learned to hunt and became a predator, devouring people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020886"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The nations also heard about him; he was captured in their trap, and they led him away in chains to the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020887"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When she realized that her waiting had been in vain and her hope was gone, she took another of her cubs and raised him to be a strong young lion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020888"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He roamed among the lions and grew into a young lion.

The land became a wasteland, and all its abundance was ruined by the thunderous sound of his roaring.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020890"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the surrounding nations from every province rose up against him, and they cast their net over him; he was caught in their trap.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020891"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They seized him, bound him with chains, and took him to the king of Babylon. They confined him in a prison, ensuring that his voice would no longer be heard proclaiming anything on the mountains of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020892"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Your mother was like a flourishing vine, deeply rooted by abundant waters. She became fruitful and full of branches, thriving because of the plentiful streams that nourished her.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020893"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">She possessed sturdy branches that served as scepters for rulers, and her stature rose high above the dense foliage. She stood tall and majestic, displaying her grandeur with the abundance of her spreading branches.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020894"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But she was uprooted in anger, thrown down to the earth, and the scorching east wind withered her fruit. Her mighty branches were shattered and dried up; fire devoured them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020895"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And now she has been placed in the wilderness, in a parched and barren land.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100020896"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A fire has sprung from one of her branches, consuming her fruit, so that she no longer has a strong branch to serve as a scepter for ruling. This is a lament, and it will remain a lament.</span></p>
