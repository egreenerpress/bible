<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023833"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The disciples went and carried out exactly as Jesus had instructed them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023834"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their cloaks on them, and seated him on top.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023835"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and scattered them along the path.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023836"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowds who went ahead of him and those who followed behind cried out, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023837"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When he entered Jerusalem, the entire city was stirred up, and people were asking, "Who is this man?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023838"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The crowd said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023839"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling there.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023840"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And he said to them, "It is written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a hideout for robbers."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023841"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And those who were blind and those who were unable to walk came to him in the temple, and he restored their sight and made them whole.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023842"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miraculous works he performed, and heard the children shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were deeply angered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023843"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they said to Him, "Do You hear what these children are saying?"

He said to it, "May no fruit ever grow on you again from this time onward." Immediately, the fig tree withered and died.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023847"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, "How quickly the fig tree has withered!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023848"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only accomplish what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023849"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe, you will receive it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023850"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When Jesus entered the temple and was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things?

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023851"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Jesus responded to them, saying, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will likewise tell you by what authority I do these things."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023852"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The baptism performed by John—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or was it of human origin?" They debated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023853"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But if we say, 'From human authority,' we are afraid of the people, because they all regard John as a prophet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023854"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They replied to Jesus, saying, "We do not know." And He said to them, "Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023855"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, “Son, go and work in the vineyard today.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023856"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He replied, "I will not go," but later he changed his mind and went.</span></p>

However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. Even after witnessing this, you did not change your minds and believe him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023860"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023861"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As the season for the fruit approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the harvest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023862"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The tenant farmers seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023864"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Finally, he sent his own son to them, thinking, "They will respect my son."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023865"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But when the tenant farmers saw the son, they said to one another, "This is the heir.

<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100023866"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</span></p>
