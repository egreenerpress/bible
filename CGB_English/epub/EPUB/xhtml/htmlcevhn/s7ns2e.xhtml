<h3 class="index-book-title">Romans Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028157"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying—and my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028158"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I experience profound grief and unceasing anguish in my heart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028159"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I could almost wish that I myself were cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers and sisters, my own people according to the flesh.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028160"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They are the Israelites, to whom belong the privilege of being God’s chosen people, the manifestation of His glory, the covenants He established, the giving of the law, the worship ordained by God, and the promises made to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028161"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ancestors belong to them, and from their lineage, according to human descent, came the Messiah, who is supreme over all, God blessed forever. Amen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028162"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It is not as though God's word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are truly part of Israel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028163"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Not all who are descended from Abraham are his true children. Rather, it is through Isaac that your offspring will be recognized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028164"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This means that those who are born by natural descent are not necessarily children of God; rather, it is the children of the promise who are considered the true descendants.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028165"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For this is the promise declared: "At this appointed time I will come, and Sarah will bear a son."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028166"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And not only this, but even when Rebecca conceived children by one man, our father Isaac—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028167"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Before the children were born, and before they had done anything good or bad—so that God’s purpose in choosing them might stand, not because of their actions but because of his call—</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028168"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It was told to her, "The older will serve the younger."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028169"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is written, "I have loved Jacob, but I have rejected Esau."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028170"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What then should we conclude? Is God unjust? Certainly not!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028171"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For God says to Moses, "I will show mercy to whom I choose to show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I choose to have compassion."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028172"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, it does not depend on human desire or effort, but on God, who shows mercy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028173"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, so that I might demonstrate my power through you and that my name might be proclaimed throughout the entire earth."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028174"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, he shows mercy to those he chooses to show mercy, and he hardens the hearts of those he chooses to harden.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028175"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">You might then say to me, "Why does God still find fault with us? For who can resist His will?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028176"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But who are you, O man, to argue against God? Can the created thing say to its creator, "Why have you made me this way?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028177"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honorable purposes and another for common use?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028178"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What if God, desiring to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, patiently endured those destined for destruction—vessels of wrath prepared for ruin?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028179"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And this was done so that He might reveal the wealth of His glorious nature to those who are objects of His mercy—those whom He had prepared beforehand to receive His glory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028180"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">This includes us, whom He has called—not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028181"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is also written in Hosea: "I will call those who were not my people, 'my people,' and her who was not beloved, 'beloved.'"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028182"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">A time will come when in the very place where it was declared to them, "You are not my people," they will be called "children of the living God."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028183"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Isaiah also proclaims concerning Israel, "Even if the number of the people of Israel is as vast as the sand by the sea, only a remnant will be saved."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028184"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For He will bring His work to completion and execute it swiftly in justice, because the Lord will carry out His decisive action upon the earth without delay.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028185"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As Isaiah said long ago, "If the Lord of Hosts had not preserved a remnant for us, we would have become like Sodom and been made similar to Gomorrah."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028186"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What then can we conclude? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have obtained righteousness—a righteousness that comes through faith.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028187"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But Israel, though pursuing the principle of righteousness, has not achieved that righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028188"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why is this so? Because they did not pursue it through faith, but as if it could be achieved by their own works based on the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028189"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">As it is written: "Look, I am placing in Zion a stone that causes stumbling and a rock that brings offense; but whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</span></p>
