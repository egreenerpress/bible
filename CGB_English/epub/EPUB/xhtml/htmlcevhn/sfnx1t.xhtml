<h3 class="index-book-title">I Corinthians Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028542"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028543"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Even if I am not recognized as an apostle by others, I certainly am to you, for you yourselves are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028544"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">My response to those who question me is this:</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028545"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do we not have the right to eat and drink?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028546"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do we not have the right to bring along a believing wife, just as the other apostles do, and as the brothers of the Lord do, and as Cephas does?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028547"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do only Barnabas and I not have the right to refrain from working?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028548"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Who goes to war at their own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink its milk?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028549"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Am I saying these things based on human reasoning alone? Or does the law itself not say the same?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028550"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is God concerned only about oxen?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028551"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Or does he say this entirely for our benefit? Indeed, it is written for our sake: the one who plows should plow with hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in the expectation of sharing in the harvest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028552"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If we have planted spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to expect that we might harvest some material benefits from you?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028553"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If others have the right to expect support from you, shouldn’t we have that right even more? Yet we have not made use of this right. Instead, we endure all things so that we might not create any obstacle to the gospel of Christ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028554"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not understand that those who serve in the sacred duties of the temple receive their sustenance from the temple offerings? And those who officiate at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028555"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, the Lord has established that those who proclaim the good news should receive their livelihood from the good news.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028556"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, I have not taken advantage of these rights, nor have I written these things so that they should be applied to me. For it would be better for me to die than to allow anyone to nullify the grounds of my boasting.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028557"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Though I proclaim the gospel, I have no reason to boast, for I am compelled to do so. Indeed, it would be a great misfortune for me if I did not preach the gospel!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028558"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If I carry out this task willingly, I deserve a reward; but if I do it unwillingly, I am still entrusted with the responsibility of sharing the gospel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028559"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What, then, is my reward? It is this: that when I proclaim the gospel, I may offer it free of charge, not making full use of my rights in the gospel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028560"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Although I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a servant to all people, so that I might win as many as possible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028561"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To the Jews, I became like a Jew, so that I might win over the Jews. To those who are under the law, I became as one under the law—though I myself am not under the law—so that I might gain those who are under the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028562"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To those who are not under the law, I became as one not under the law—though I am not free from God’s law but am under the law of Christ—so that I might win those who are not under the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028563"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I have become like the weak to win over the weak. I have adapted myself to all kinds of people in every way possible, so that by any means I might bring some to salvation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028564"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I do this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings together with you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028565"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not realize that in a race all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028566"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Every athlete who competes exercises self-control in all things. They do it to win a temporary prize, but we do it to receive an eternal one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028567"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I run with purpose and determination, not aimlessly; I fight with focus and intent, not as one who swings at empty air.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028568"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I discipline my body and bring it under control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified or found unworthy.</span></p>
