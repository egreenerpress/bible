<h3 class="index-book-title">Romans Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028070"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What then should we conclude? Should we persist in sin so that grace may increase?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028071"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Certainly not! How can we, who have died to sin, continue to live in it?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028072"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not understand that all of us who were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028073"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, through baptism, we are united with Christ in his death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, we too may live a new life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028074"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028075"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Understanding this: our former self was crucified with Christ, so that the power of sin might be broken, and we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028076"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For the one who has died has been released from the power of sin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028077"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">If we have died with Christ, we trust that we will also live with him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028078"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Understanding that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has any power or control over Him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028079"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For when he died, he died to sin once and for all; but now that he lives, he lives for God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028080"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, consider yourselves truly dead to sin, but fully alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028081"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, do not allow sin to rule over your mortal body, compelling you to obey its desires.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028082"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do not offer the parts of your body as tools for unrighteousness in service to sin. Instead, present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness for God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028083"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Sin will no longer rule over you, because you are not under the authority of the law, but under the power of grace.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028084"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What then? Should we continue to sin because we are no longer under the law but under grace? Certainly not!</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028085"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Do you not realize that whoever you submit yourselves to as servants, obeying their commands, you become the servants of that very one—whether it is sin leading to death or obedience leading to righteousness?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028086"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But thanks be to God, for though you were once enslaved to sin, you have wholeheartedly obeyed the teaching that was entrusted to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028087"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Since you have been set free from sin, you have become servants of righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028088"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I am speaking in terms you can understand, considering the limitations of your human nature. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as instruments of impurity and wickedness, leading to even greater sin, now in the same way offer your bodies as instruments of righteousness, leading to holiness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028089"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When you were enslaved to sin, you were not bound to righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028090"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">What benefit did you gain from those actions that now fill you with shame? The ultimate outcome of such things is death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028091"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But now, having been set free from sin and having become servants of God, you bear fruit that leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100028092"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The consequence of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
