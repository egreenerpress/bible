<h3 class="index-book-title">Matthew Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024010"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be compared to ten young women who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024011"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Five of them were prudent, and five were careless.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024012"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The foolish ones took their lamps but did not bring any oil with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024013"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The prudent ones, however, took oil in their containers along with their lamps.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024014"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While the bridegroom delayed, they all grew drowsy and fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024015"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">At midnight, a shout rang out: "Look, the bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him!"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024016"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then all those young women got up and prepared their lamps.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024017"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The foolish ones said to the wise, "Share some of your oil with us, because our lamps are going out."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024018"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The wise ones replied, "No, that cannot be, for there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024019"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">While they were away buying oil, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were prepared went in with him to the wedding celebration, and the door was closed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024020"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Afterward, the other virgins also arrived, pleading, "Lord, Lord, open the door for us."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024021"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">But he responded, saying, "Truly I tell you, I do not know you."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024022"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to travel to a distant land. He called his own servants and entrusted his possessions to them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024024"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To one servant he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability. Then he immediately went on his journey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024025"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the servant who had received the five talents went and invested them, and gained another five talents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024026"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the same way, the one who had received two talents also gained two more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024027"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">However, the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024028"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">After a considerable period of time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024029"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the one who had received five talents came forward and presented five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents. Look, I have gained five more talents in addition to them.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024030"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been trustworthy in managing a small amount; I will put you in charge of much more. Come and share in your master's joy."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024031"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">22 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The servant who had received two talents also came forward and said, “Master, you entrusted me with two talents. Look, I have gained two more talents in addition to them.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024032"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">23 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been trustworthy with a small amount, so I will put you in charge of much greater things. Come and share in your master's joy."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024033"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">24 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the servant who had received the one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a demanding man, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter seed.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024034"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">25 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was afraid, so I went and buried your talent in the ground. Here, you have back what belongs to you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024035"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The master replied to him, "You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter seed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024036"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">27 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Therefore, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, so that when I returned, I would have received my own funds back with interest.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024037"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">28 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Take the talent away from him, then, and give it to the one who has ten talents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024038"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">To everyone who has, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from the one who has nothing, even what they do have will be taken away.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024039"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">30 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024040"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When the Son of Man comes in his glory, accompanied by all the holy angels, he will then sit upon his glorious throne.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024041"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">32 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024042"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">33 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He will place the sheep at his right side, but the goats at his left.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024043"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">34 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, and receive the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024044"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">35 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you welcomed me in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024045"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">36 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"I was without clothing, and you gave me something to wear; I was ill, and you cared for me; I was imprisoned, and you came to me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024046"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">37 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the righteous will respond to him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024047"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">38 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you, or see you without clothes and give you something to wear?</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024048"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">39 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">"Or when did we see you sick or in prison and come to help you?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024049"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">40 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The King will respond and say to them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these, my brothers and sisters, you did for me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024050"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">41 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he will also say to those on his left, "Go away from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024051"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">42 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024052"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">43 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was a foreigner, and you did not welcome me; I was without clothing, and you did not give me anything to wear; I was ill and in prison, and you did not come to care for me.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024053"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">44 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then they will respond, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, or as a stranger, or without clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of you?’</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024054"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">45 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he will respond to them, saying, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100024055"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">46 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous will enter into eternal life.</span></p>
