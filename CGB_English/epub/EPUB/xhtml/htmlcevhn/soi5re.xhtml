<h3 class="index-book-title">Revelation Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030842"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">1 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. This star was given the key to the shaft of the abyss.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030843"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then he opened the abyss, and smoke rose from it like the smoke of a massive furnace. The sun and the sky were darkened because of the smoke from the abyss.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030844"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">And out of the smoke came locusts that descended upon the earth. They were granted authority, similar to the power that scorpions of the earth possess.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030845"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were instructed not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any green plant, nor any tree, but only those people who did not have the mark of God on their foreheads.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030846"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They were granted the power not to kill them, but to cause them suffering for five months. Their torment was like the pain inflicted by a scorpion when it stings a person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030847"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">6 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In those days, people will desperately seek death but will not be able to find it. They will long to die, yet death will elude them and flee from their grasp.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030848"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">7 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses ready for battle. On their heads were what seemed to be crowns resembling gold, and their faces looked like human faces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030849"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They had hair like that of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030850"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">9 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They wore armor that appeared to be made of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the sound of many horse-drawn chariots charging into battle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030851"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">10 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They had tails resembling those of scorpions, with stings in their tails, and their power was to harm people for five months.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030852"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They had a ruler over them, who is the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew, his name is Abaddon, and in Greek, his name is Apollyon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030853"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">12 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">One disaster has passed, and now look—two more are yet to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030854"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four corners of the golden altar that stands in the presence of God.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030855"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">14 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">He said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030856"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">15 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Then the four angels, who had been prepared for this specific moment—an hour, a day, a month, and a year—were released to bring death to a third of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030857"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">16 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The number of the mounted troops was two hundred million, and I heard the count of them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030858"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">17 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">In the vision, I saw the horses and their riders. They wore breastplates that gleamed like fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030859"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">18 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">By these three plagues, a third of humanity was killed—by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came forth from their mouths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030860"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">19 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Their power lies in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails resemble serpents with heads, and they use them to inflict harm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030861"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">20 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The remaining people who were not killed by these plagues still refused to turn away from the works of their hands. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—idols that cannot see, hear, or move.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100030862"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">21 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They did not turn away from their murders, nor from their witchcraft, nor from their sexual immorality, nor from their thefts.</span></p>
