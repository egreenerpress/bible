They retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, brought them to Jabesh, and cremated them there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" lang="en"><span class="heading-2-text"><a id="ref_Toc100008023"></a></span><span class="verse-number2">13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">They gathered their bones and buried them beneath a tree in Jabesh, then observed a fast for seven days.</span></p>
